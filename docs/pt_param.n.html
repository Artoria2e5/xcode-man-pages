   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

Are you lost ? Do you have trouble understanding this document ? In that case
  please read the overview provided by the <i>Introduction to Parser Tools</i>.
  This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the current package is a
  part of.
<p class="Pp">Welcome to the PackRat Machine (short: <i>PARAM</i>), a virtual
    machine geared towards the support of recursive descent parsers, especially
    packrat parsers. Towards this end it has features like the caching and reuse
    of partial results, the caching of the encountered input, and the ability to
    backtrack in both input and AST creation.</p>
<p class="Pp">This document specifies the machine in terms of its architectural
    state and instruction set.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ARCHITECTURAL_STATE"><a class="permalink" href="#ARCHITECTURAL_STATE">ARCHITECTURAL
  STATE</a></h1>
Any PARAM implementation has to manage at least the following state:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>Input</i> (IN)</dt>
  <dd>This is the channel the characters to process are read from.
    <p class="Pp">This part of the machine's state is used and modified by the
        instructions defined in the section <b>Input Handling</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><i>Current Character</i> (CC)</dt>
  <dd>The character from the <i>input</i> currently tested against its possible
      alternatives.
    <p class="Pp">This part of the machine's state is used and modified by the
        instructions defined in the section <b>Character Processing</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><i>Current Location</i> (CL)</dt>
  <dd>The location of the <i>current character</i> in the <i>input</i>, as
      offset relative to the beginning of the input. Character offsets are
      counted from <b>0</b>.
    <p class="Pp">This part of the machine's state is used and modified by the
        instructions defined in the sections <b>Character Processing</b>,
        <b>Location Handling</b>, and <b>Nonterminal Execution</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><i>Location Stack</i> (LS)</dt>
  <dd>A stack of locations in the <i>input</i>, saved for possible backtracking.
    <p class="Pp">This part of the machine's state is used and modified by the
        instructions defined in the sections <b>Character Processing</b>,
        <b>Location Handling</b>, and <b>Nonterminal Execution</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><i>Status</i> (ST)</dt>
  <dd>The status of the last attempt of testing the <i>input</i>, indicating
      either success or failure.
    <p class="Pp">This part of the machine's state is used and modified by the
        instructions defined in the sections <b>Status Control</b>, <b>Character
        Processing</b>, and <b>Nonterminal Execution</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><i>Semantic Value</i> (SV)</dt>
  <dd>The current semantic value, either empty, or a node for AST constructed
      from the input.
    <p class="Pp">This part of the machine's state is used and modified by the
        instructions defined in the sections <b>Value Construction</b>, and
        <b>AST Construction</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><i>AST Reduction Stack</i> (ARS)</dt>
  <dd>The stack of partial ASTs constructed during the processing of nonterminal
      symbols.
    <p class="Pp">This part of the machine's state is used and modified by the
        instructions defined in the sections <b>Value Construction</b>, and
        <b>AST Construction</b>.</p>

  <dd>The stack of reduction stacks, saved for possible backtracking.
    <p class="Pp">This part of the machine's state is used and modified by the
        instructions defined in the sections <b>Value Construction</b>, and
        <b>AST Construction</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><i>Error Status</i> (ER)</dt>
  <dd>The machine's current knowledge of errors. This is either empty, or set to
      a pair of location in the input and the set of messages for that location.
    <p class="Pp"><i>Note</i> that this part of the machine's state can be set
        even if the last test of the <i>current character</i> was successful.
        For example, the *-operator (matching a sub-expression zero or more
        times) in a PEG is always successful, even if it encounters a problem
        further in the input and has to backtrack. Such problems must not be
        forgotten when continuing the parsing.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This part of the machine's state is used and modified by the
        instructions defined in the sections <b>Error Handling</b>, <b>Character
        Processing</b>, and <b>Nonterminal Execution</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><i>Error Stack</i> (ES)</dt>
  <dd>The stack of error stati, saved for backtracking. This enables the machine
      to merge current and older error stati when performing backtracking in
      choices after an failed match.
    <p class="Pp">This part of the machine's state is used and modified by the
        instructions defined in the sections <b>Error Handling</b>, <b>Character
        Processing</b>, and <b>Nonterminal Execution</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><i>Nonterminal Cache</i> (NC)</dt>
  <dd>A cache of machine states keyed by pairs name of nonterminal symbol and
      location in the input. Each pair (N, L) is associated with a 4-tuple
      holding the values to use for CL, ST, SV, and ER after the nonterminal N
      was parsed starting from the location L. It is a performance aid for
      backtracking parsers, allowing them to avoid an expensive reparsing of
      complex nonterminal symbols if they have been encountered before at a
      given location.
    <p class="Pp">The key location is where machine started the attempt to match
        the named nonterminal symbol, and the location in the saved 4-tuple is
        where machine ended up after the attempt completed, independent of the
        success of the attempt.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This part of the machine's state is used and modified by the
        instructions defined in the section <b>Nonterminal Execution</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><i>Terminal Cache</i> (TC)</dt>
  <dd>A cache of characters read from IN, with their location in IN as pair of
      line and column, keyed by the location in IN, this time as character
      offset from the beginning of IN. It is a performance aid for backtracking
      parsers, allowing them to avoid a possibly expensive rereading of
      characters from IN, or even enabling backtracking at, i.e. in the case of
      IN not randomly seekable.

<h1 class="Sh" id="INSTRUCTION_SET"><a class="permalink" href="#INSTRUCTION_SET">INSTRUCTION
  SET</a></h1>
With the machine's architectural state specified it is now possible to specify
  the instruction set operating on that state and to be implemented by any
  realization of the PARAM. The 37 instructions are grouped roughly by the state
  they influence and/or query during their execution.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="INPUT_HANDLING"><a class="permalink" href="#INPUT_HANDLING">INPUT
  HANDLING</a></h2>
The instructions in this section mainly access IN, pulling the characters to
  process into the machine.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>input_next</b> <i>msg</i></dt>
  <dd>This method reads the next character, i.e. the character after CL, from
      IN. If successful this character becomes CC, CL is advanced by one, ES is
      cleared, and the operation is recorded as a success in ST.
    <p class="Pp">The operation may read the character from IN if the next
        character is not yet known to TC. If successful the new character is
        stored in TC, with its location (line, column), and the operation
        otherwise behaves as specified above. Future reads from the same
        location, possible due to backtracking, will then be satisfied from TC
        instead of IN.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If, on the other hand, the end of IN was reached, the
        operation is recorded as failed in ST, CL is left unchanged, and the
        pair of CL and <i>msg</i> becomes the new ES.</p>

The instructions in this section access and manipulate NC.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>symbol_restore</b> <i>symbol</i></dt>
  <dd>This instruction checks if NC contains data for the nonterminal
      <i>symbol</i> at CL, or not. The result of the instruction is a boolean
      flag, with <b>True</b> indicating that data was found in the cache. In
      that case the instruction has further updated the architectural state of
      the machine with the cached information, namely CL, ST, ER, and SV.
    <p class="Pp">The method with which the instruction's result is transformed
        into control flow is left undefined and the responsibility of the
        implementation.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>symbol_save</b> <i>symbol</i></dt>
  <dd>This instructions saves the current settings of CL, ST, ER, and SV in NC,
      using the pair of nonterminal <i>symbol</i> and the last location saved in
      LS as key.</dd>

      range of IN from one character after the last location saved on LS to CL
      and stores it in SV. ...</dd>
  <dt><b>value_reduce</b> <i>symbol</i></dt>
  <dd>This instruction generally behaves like <b>value_nonterminal_leaf</b>,
      except that it takes all AST nodes on ARS, if any, and makes them the
      children of the new node, with the last node saved on ARS becoming the
      right-most / last child. Note that ARS is not modfied by this
    operation.</dd>

Normally this section would contain the specifications of the control flow
  instructions of the PARAM, i.e. (un)conditional jumps and the like. However,
  this part of the PARAM is intentionally left unspecified. This allows the
  implementations to freely choose how to implement control flow.
<p class="Pp">The implementation of this machine in Parser Tools, i.e the
    package <b>pt::rde</b>, is not only coded in Tcl, but also relies on Tcl
    commands to provide it with control flow (instructions).</p>
