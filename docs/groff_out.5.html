groff_out - groff intermediate output format
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This manual page describes the <i>intermediate output</i> format of the GNU
  <b>roff</b>(7) text processing system <b>groff</b>(1). This output is produced
  by a run of the GNU <b>troff</b>(1) program. It contains already all
  device-specific information, but it is not yet fed into a device postprocessor
  program.
<p class="Pp">As the GNU <i>roff</i> processor <b>groff</b>(1) is a wrapper
    program around <b>troff</b> that automatically calls a postprocessor, this
    output does not show up normally. This is why it is called
    <i>intermediate</i> within the <i>groff</i> <i>system</i>. The <b>groff</b>
    program provides the option <b>-Z</b> to inhibit postprocessing, such that
    the produced <i>intermediate output</i> is sent to standard output just like
    calling <b>troff</b> manually.</p>
<p class="Pp">In this document, the term <i>troff output</i> describes what is
    output by the GNU <b>troff</b> program, while <i>intermediate output</i>
    refers to the language that is accepted by the parser that prepares this
    output for the postprocessors. This parser is smarter on whitespace and
    implements obsolete elements for compatibility, otherwise both formats are
    the same. Both formats can be viewed directly with <b>gxditview</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">The main purpose of the <i>intermediate output</i> concept is to
    facilitate the development of postprocessors by providing a common
    programming interface for all devices. It has a language of its own that is
    completely different from the <b>groff</b>(7) language. While the
    <i>groff</i> language is a high-level programming language for text
    processing, the <i>intermediate output</i> language is a kind of low-level
    assembler language by specifying all positions on the page for writing and
    drawing.</p>
<p class="Pp">The pre-<i>groff</i> <i>roff</i> versions are denoted as
    <i>classical</i> <i>troff</i>. The <i>intermediate output</i> produced by
    <b>groff</b> is fairly readable, while <i>classical troff</i> output was
    hard to understand because of strange habits that are still supported, but
    not used any longer by <i>GNU</i> <i>troff</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="LANGUAGE_CONCEPTS"><a class="permalink" href="#LANGUAGE_CONCEPTS">LANGUAGE
  CONCEPTS</a></h1>
During the run of <b>troff</b>, the <i>roff</i> input is cracked down to the
  information on what has to be printed at what position on the intended device.
  So the language of the <i>intermediate output</i> format can be quite small.
  Its only elements are commands with or without arguments. In this document,
  the term &quot;command&quot; always refers to the <i>intermediate output</i>
  language, never to the <i>roff</i> language used for document formatting.
  There are commands for positioning and text writing, for drawing, and for
  device controlling.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Separation"><a class="permalink" href="#Separation">Separation</a></h2>
<i>Classical troff output</i> had strange requirements on whitespace. The
  <b>groff</b> output parser, however, is smart about whitespace by making it
  maximally optional. The whitespace characters, i.e., the <i>tab</i>,
  <i>space</i>, and <i>newline</i> characters, always have a syntactical
  meaning. They are never printable because spacing within the output is always
  done by positioning commands.
<p class="Pp">Any sequence of <i>space</i> or <i>tab</i> characters is treated
    as a single <i>syntactical</i> <i>space</i>. It separates commands and
    arguments, but is only required when there would occur a clashing between
    the command code and the arguments without the space. Most often, this
    happens when variable length command names, arguments, argument lists, or
    command clusters meet. Commands and arguments with a known, fixed length
    need not be separated by <i>syntactical</i> <i>space</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">A line break is a syntactical element, too. Every command argument
    can be followed by whitespace, a comment, or a newline character. Thus a
    <i>syntactical line break</i> is defined to consist of optional
    <i>syntactical space</i> that is optionally followed by a comment, and a
    newline character.</p>
<p class="Pp">The normal commands, those for positioning and text, consist of a
    single letter taking a fixed number of arguments. For historical reasons,
    the parser allows to stack such commands on the same line, but fortunately,
    in <i>groff intermediate</i> <i>output</i>, every command with at least one
    argument is followed by a line break, thus providing excellent
  readability.</p>
<p class="Pp">The other commands &#x2014; those for drawing and device
    controlling &#x2014; have a more complicated structure; some recognize long
    command names, and some take a variable number of arguments. So all <b>D</b>
    and <b>x</b> commands were designed to request a <i>syntactical line
    break</i> after their last argument. Only one command, `<b>x&#x00A0;X</b>'
    has an argument that can stretch over several lines, all other commands must
    have all of their arguments on the same line as the command, i.e., the
    arguments may not be splitted by a line break.</p>
<p class="Pp">Empty lines, i.e., lines containing only space and/or a comment,
    can occur everywhere. They are just ignored.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Argument_Units"><a class="permalink" href="#Argument_Units">Argument
  Units</a></h2>
Some commands take integer arguments that are assumed to represent values in a
  measurement unit, but the letter for the corresponding <i>scale indicator</i>
  is not written with the output command arguments; see <b>groff</b>(7) and the
  <i>groff info file</i> for more on this topic. Most commands assume the scale
  indicator&#x00A0;<b>\$@</b> the basic unit of the device, some
  use&#x00A0;<b>\$@</b> the <i>scaled point unit</i> of the device, while
  others, such as the color commands expect plain integers. Note that these
  scale indicators are relative to the chosen device. They are defined by the
  parameters specified in the device's <i>DESC</i> file; see
  <b>groff_font</b>(5).
<p class="Pp">Note that single characters can have the eighth bit set, as can
    the names of fonts and special characters. The names of characters and fonts
    can be of arbitrary length. A character that is to be printed will always be
    in the current font.</p>
<p class="Pp">A string argument is always terminated by the next whitespace
    character (space, tab, or newline); an embedded <b>#</b> character is
    regarded as part of the argument, not as the beginning of a comment command.
    An integer argument is already terminated by the next non-digit character,
    which then is regarded as the first character of the next argument or
    command.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Document_Parts"><a class="permalink" href="#Document_Parts">Document
  Parts</a></h2>
A correct <i>intermediate output</i> document consists of two parts, the
  <i>prologue</i> and the <i>body</i>.
<p class="Pp">The task of the <i>prologue</i> is to set the general device
    parameters using three exactly specified commands. The <i>groff prologue</i>
    is guaranteed to consist of the following three lines (in that order):</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><b>x&#x00A0;T</b> <i>device</i>
  <br/>
  <b>x&#x00A0;res</b> <i>n&#x00A0;h&#x00A0;v</i>
  <br/>
  <b>x init</b></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">with the arguments set as outlined in the section <b>Device
    Control Commands</b>. But the parser for the <i>intermediate output</i>
    format is able to swallow additional whitespace and comments as well.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>body</i> is the main section for processing the document
    data. Syntactically, it is a sequence of any commands different from the
    ones used in the <i>prologue</i>. Processing is terminated as soon as the
    first <b>x&#x00A0;stop</b> command is encountered; the last line of any
    <i>groff intermediate output</i> always contains such a command.</p>
<p class="Pp">Semantically, the <i>body</i> is page oriented. A new page is
    started by a <b>p</b>&#x00A0;command. Positioning, writing, and drawing
    commands are always done within the current page, so they cannot occur
    before the first <b>p</b>&#x00A0;command. Absolute positioning (by the
    <b>H</b> and <b>V</b>&#x00A0;commands) is done relative to the current page,
    all other positioning is done relative to the current location within this
    page.</p>

The commands in this subsection have a command code consisting of a single
  character, taking a fixed number of arguments. Most of them are commands for
  positioning and text writing. These commands are smart about whitespace.
  Optionally, <i>syntactical space</i> can be inserted before, after, and
  between the command letter and its arguments. All of these commands are
  stackable, i.e., they can be preceded by other simple commands or followed by
  arbitrary other commands on the same line. A separating <i>syntactical
  space</i> is only necessary when two integer arguments would clash or if the
  preceding argument ends with a string argument.

Each graphics or drawing command in the <i>intermediate output</i> starts with
  the letter&#x00A0;<b>D</b> followed by one or two characters that specify a
  subcommand; this is followed by a fixed or variable number of integer
  arguments that are separated by a single space character. A
  <b>D</b>&#x00A0;command may not be followed by another command on the same
  line (apart from a comment), so each <b>D</b>&#x00A0;command is terminated by
  a <i>syntactical line</i> <i>break</i>.
<p class="Pp"><b>troff</b> output follows the classical spacing rules (no space
    between command and subcommand, all arguments are preceded by a single space
    character), but the parser allows optional space between the command letters
    and makes the space before the first argument optional. As usual, each space
    can be any sequence of tab and space characters.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some graphics commands can take a variable number of arguments. In
    this case, they are integers representing a size measured in basic
    units&#x00A0;<b>\$@</b> The arguments called \c $\*[@arg1] sub 1$,
    $\*[@arg1] sub 2$, .\|.\|., $\*[@arg1] sub n$ \c \{\ <i>\*[@arg1]1</i>,

    $\*[@arg1] sub 1$, $\*[@arg1] sub 2$, .\|.\|., $\*[@arg1] sub n$ \c \{\
    <i>\*[@arg1]1</i>, <i>\*[@arg1]2</i>, \&amp;..., <i>\*[@arg1]n</i> stand for
    vertical distances where positive means down, negative up. All these
    distances are offsets relative to the current location.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unless indicated otherwise, each graphics command directly

  Control Commands</a></h2>
Each device control command starts with the letter <b>x</b> followed by a space
  character (optional or arbitrary space/tab in <i>groff</i>) and a subcommand
  letter or word; each argument (if any) must be preceded by a
  <i>syntactical</i> <i>space</i>. All <b>x</b> commands are terminated by a
  <i>syntactical line break</i>; no device control command can be followed by
  another command on the same line (except a comment).
<p class="Pp">The subcommand is basically a single letter, but to increase
    readability, it can be written as a word, i.e., an arbitrary sequence of
    characters terminated by the next tab, space, or newline character. All
    characters of the subcommand word but the first are simply ignored. For
    example, <b>troff</b> outputs the initialization command <b>x&#x00A0;i</b>
    as <b>x&#x00A0;init</b> and the resolution command <b>x&#x00A0;r</b> as
    <b>x&#x00A0;res</b>. But writings like <b>x&#x00A0;i_like_groff</b> and
    <b>x&#x00A0;roff_is_groff</b> resp. are accepted as well to mean the same

In <i>classical troff</i> output, the writing of a single character was mostly
  done by a very strange command that combined a horizontal move and the

  a 3-character argument consisting of exactly 2&#x00A0;digits and a character.

<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">In <i>groff</i>, arbitrary <i>syntactical space</i> around and

    the same line ends with an argument of variable length a separating space is

The <i>roff</i> postprocessors are programs that have the task to translate the
  <i>intermediate output</i> into actions that are sent to a device. A device
  can be some piece of hardware such as a printer, or a software file format
  suitable for graphical or text processing. The <i>groff</i> system provides
  powerful means that make the programming of such postprocessors an easy task.
<p class="Pp">There is a library function that parses the <i>intermediate
    output</i> and sends the information obtained to the device via methods of a
    class with a common interface for each device. So a <i>groff</i>
    postprocessor must only redefine the methods of this class. For details, see

The <i>intermediate output</i> language of the <i>classical troff</i> was first
  documented in <i>[CSTR&#x00A0;#97]</i>. The <i>groff intermediate output</i>
  format is compatible with this specification except for the following
  features.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>\[bu]</dt>
  <dd>The classical quasi device independence is not yet implemented.</dd>
  <dt>\[bu]</dt>
  <dd>The old hardware was very different from what we use today. So the
      <i>groff</i> devices are also fundamentally different from the ones in
      <i>classical</i> <i>troff</i>. For example, the classical PostScript
      device was called <i>post</i> and had a resolution of 720 units per inch,
      while <i>groff</i>'s <i>ps</i> device has a resolution of 72000 units per
      inch. Maybe, by implementing some rescaling mechanism similar to the
      classical quasi device independence, these could be integrated into modern
      <i>groff</i>.</dd>
  <dt>\[bu]</dt>
  <dd>The B-spline command <b>D~</b> is correctly handled by the <i>intermediate
      output</i> parser, but the drawing routines aren't implemented in some of
      the postprocessor programs.</dd>
  <dt>\[bu]</dt>
  <dd>The argument of the commands <b>s</b> and <b>x H</b> has the implicit unit
      scaled point&#x00A0;<b>\$@</b> in <i>groff</i>, while <i>classical
      troff</i> had point (<b>\$@</b> This isn't an incompatibility, but a
      compatible extension, for both units coincide for all devices without a
      <i>sizescale</i> parameter, including all classical and the <i>groff</i>
      text devices. The few <i>groff</i> devices with a sizescale parameter
      either did not exist, had a different name, or seem to have had a
      different resolution. So conflicts with classical devices are very
      unlikely.</dd>
  <dt>\[bu]</dt>
  <dd>The position changing after the commands <b>Dp</b>, <b>DP</b>, and
      <b>Dt</b> is illogical, but as old versions of groff used this feature it
      is kept for compatibility reasons.</dd>
