Locale::Codes - a distribution of modules to handle locale codes
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<b>Locale-Codes</b> is a distribution containing a set of modules designed to
  work with sets of codes which uniquely identify something. For example, there
  are codes associated with different countries, different currencies, different
  languages, etc. These sets of codes are typically maintained in some standard.
<p class="Pp">This distribution provides a way to work with these lists of
    codes. Because the data from the various standards is not available in any
    sort of consistent API, access to the lists is not available in any direct
    fashion. To compensate for this, the list of codes is stored internally
    within this distribution, and the distribution is updated on a regular basis
    to include all known codes at that point in time. This does mean that it is
    necessary to keep this distribution up-to-date to keep up with the various
    changes that are made in the various standards.</p>
<p class="Pp">Traditionally, a module has been created to work with each type of
    code sets. So, there is a module for working with country lists, one for
    currency lists, etc. Since version 3.00, all of these individual modules
    were written as wrappers around a central module (which was not intended to
    be used directly) which did all of the real work.</p>
<p class="Pp">Starting with version 3.50, the central module was reworked
    slightly to provide an object-oriented interface. All of the modules for
    working with individual types of code sets were reworked to use the improved
    OO module, so the traditional interfaces still work as they always have. As
    a result, you are free to use the traditional functional (non-OO)
    interfaces, or to use the OO interface and bypass the wrapper modules
    entirely.</p>
<p class="Pp">Both methods will be supported in the future, so use the one that
    is best suited to your needs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Within each type, any number of code sets are allowed. For
    example, sets of country codes are maintained in several different locations
    including the ISO-3166 standard, the IANA, and by the United Nations. The
    lists of countries are similar, but not identical. Multiple code sets are
    supported, though trying to convert from one code set to another will not
    always work since the list of countries is not one-to-one.</p>
<p class="Pp">All data in all of these modules comes directly from the original
    standards (or as close to direct as possible), so it should be up-to-date at
    the time of release.</p>
<p class="Pp">I plan on releasing a new version several times a year to
    incorporate any changes made in the standards. However, I don't always know
    about changes that occur, so if any of the standards change, and you want a
    new release sooner, just email me and I'll get one out.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OBJECT-ORIENTED_METHODS"><a class="permalink" href="#OBJECT-ORIENTED_METHODS">OBJECT-ORIENTED
  METHODS</a></h1>
The following methods are available.
<p class="Pp">In all methods, when specifying a code set, the name (as a string)
    is always available.</p>
<p class="Pp">Traditionally, you could also use a perl constant to specify the
    code set. In order to do so with the OO interface, you have to import the
    constants. To do that, load the module with:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   use Locale::Codes ':constants';
</pre>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>new ( [TYPE [,CODESET]] )</b></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li"></span>
    <pre>
   $obj = new Locale::Codes;
   $obj = new Locale::Codes 'country';
   $obj = new Locale::Codes 'country','alpha-3';
   $obj = new Locale::Codes 'country',LOCALE_COUNTRY_ALPHA_3;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This creates a new object that can access the data. If no type
        is specified (in the first argument), you must use the <b>type</b>
        method described below. No operations will work unless the type is
        specified.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The second argument is the default code set to use. This is
        optional, as each type has a default code set. The default code set can
        be set using the <b>codeset</b> method below.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The last example is only available if the constants were
        imported when the module was loaded.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>show_errors ( FLAG )</b></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li"></span>
    <pre>
   $obj-&gt;show_errors(1);
   $obj-&gt;show_errors(0);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">By default, error messages will be produced when bad data is
        passed to any method. By passing in '0', these will be turned off so
        that all failures will be silent.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>type ( TYPE )</b></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li"></span>
    <pre>
   $obj-&gt;type($type)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This will set the type of codes that will be worked with.
        <span class="Li">$type</span> may be any of the recognized types of code
        sets, including:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
   country
   language
   currency
   script
   etc.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The list of valid types, and the code sets supported in each,
        are described in the Locale::Codes::Types document.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This method can be called any number of times to toggle
        between different types of code sets.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>codeset ( CODESET )</b></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li"></span>
    <pre>
   $obj-&gt;codeset($codeset);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This sets the default code set to use. The list of code sets
        available for each type are described in the Locale::Codes::Types
        document.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In all other methods below, when an optional <b>CODESET</b>
        argument is omitted, it will default to this value.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>code2name ( CODE [,CODESET] [,'retired'] )</b></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li"></span>
    <pre>
   $name = $obj-&gt;code2name($code [,$codeset] [,'retired']);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This functions take a code and returns a string which contains
        the name of the element identified. If the code is not a valid code in
        the <b>CODESET</b> specified then
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> will be returned.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The name of the element is the name as specified in the
        standard, and as a result, different variations of an element name may
        be returned for different values of <b>CODESET</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For example, the alpha-2 country code set defines the
        two-letter code &quot;bo&quot; to be &quot;Bolivia, Plurinational State
        of&quot;, whereas the alpha-3 code set defines the code 'bol' to be the
        country &quot;Bolivia (Plurinational State of)&quot;. So:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
   $obj-&gt;code2name('bo','alpha-2');
      =&gt; 'Bolivia, Plurinational State of'

   $obj-&gt;code2name('bol','alpha-3');
      =&gt; 'Bolivia (Plurinational State of)'
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">By default, only active codes will be used, but if the string
        'retired' is passed in as an argument, both active and retired codes
        will be examined.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>name2code ( NAME [,CODESET] [,'retired'] )</b></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li"></span>
    <pre>
   $code = $obj-&gt;name2code($name [,$codeset] [,'retired']);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This function takes the name of an element (or any of it's
        aliases) and returns the code that corresponds to it, if it exists. If
        <b>NAME</b> could not be identified as the name of one of the elements,
        then <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> will be returned.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The name is not case sensitive. Also, any known variation of a
        name may be passed in.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For example, even though the country name returned using
        'alpha-2' and 'alpha-3' country codes for Bolivia are different, either
        country name may be passed in since for each code set (in addition to
        the more common alias 'Bolivia'). So:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
   $obj-&gt;name2code('Bolivia, Plurinational State of','alpha-2');
      =&gt; bo

   $obj-&gt;name2code('Bolivia (Plurinational State of)','alpha-2');
      =&gt; bo

   $obj-&gt;name2code('Bolivia','alpha-2');
      =&gt; bo
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">By default, only active names will be used, but if the string
        'retired' is passed in as an argument, both active and retired names
        will be examined.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>code2code ( CODE [,CODESET] ,CODESET2 )</b></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li"></span>
    <pre>
   $code = $obj-&gt;code2code($code [,$codeset] ,$codeset2);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This function takes a code from one code set (<b>CODESET</b>
        or the default code set), and returns the corresponding code from
        another code set (<b>CODESET2</b>). <b>CODE</b> must exists in the code
        set specified by <b>CODESET</b> and must have a corresponding code in
        the code set specified by <b>CODESET2</b> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> will be returned.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
   $obj-&gt;code2code('fin','alpha-3','alpha-2');
      =&gt; 'fi'
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that this function does NOT support retired codes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>all_codes ( [CODESET] [,'retired'] )</b></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li"></span>
    <pre>
   @code = $obj-&gt;all_codes([$codeset] [,'retired']);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This returns a list of all code in the code set. The codes
        will be sorted.</p>
    <p class="Pp">By default, only active codes will be returned, but if the
        string 'retired' is passed in as an argument, both active and retired
        codes will be returned.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>all_names ( [CODESET] [,'retired'] )</b></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li"></span>
    <pre>
   @name = $obj-&gt;all_names([$codeset] [,'retired']);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This method returns a list of all elements names for which
        there is a corresponding code in the specified code set.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The names returned are exactly as they are specified in the
        standard, and are sorted.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Since not all elements are listed in all code sets, the list
        of elements may differ depending on the code set specified.</p>
    <p class="Pp">By default, only active names will be returned, but if the
        string 'retired' is passed in as an argument, both active and retired
        names will be returned.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The following additional methods are available and can be used to
    modify the code list data (and are therefore not generally useful).</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>rename_code ( CODE ,NEW_NAME [,CODESET] )</b></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li"></span>
    <pre>
   $flag = $obj-&gt;rename_code($code,$new_name [,$codeset]);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This method can be used to change the official name of an
        element. At that point, the name returned by the
        <span class="Li">&quot;code2name&quot;</span> method would be
        <b>NEW_NAME</b> instead of the name specified in the standard.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The original name will remain as an alias.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For example, the official country name for code 'gb' is
        'United Kingdom'. If you want to change that, you might call:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
   $obj-&gt;rename_code('gb', 'Great Britain');
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This means that calling code2name('gb') will now return 'Great
        Britain' instead of 'United Kingdom'.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If any error occurs, a warning is issued and 0 is returned. An
        error occurs if <b>CODE</b> doesn't exist in the specified code set, or
        if <b>NEW_NAME</b> is already in use but for a different element.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the method succeeds, 1 is returned.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>add_code ( CODE ,NAME [,CODESET] )</b></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li"></span>
    <pre>
   $flag = $obj-&gt;add_code($code,$name [,$codeset]);

    <p class="Pp">This method is used to add a new code and name to the
      data.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Both <b>CODE</b> and <b>NAME</b> must be unused in the data
        set or an error occurs (though <b>NAME</b> may be used in a different
        data set).</p>
    <p class="Pp">For example, to create the fictitious country named
        &quot;Duchy of Grand Fenwick&quot; with codes &quot;gf&quot; and
        &quot;fen&quot;, use the following:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

   $obj-&gt;add_code(&quot;fe&quot;,&quot;Duchy of Grand Fenwick&quot;,'alpha-2');
   $obj-&gt;add_code(&quot;fen&quot;,&quot;Duchy of Grand Fenwick&quot;,'alpha-3');

    <p class="Pp"><b>NAME</b> must be one of a list of at least two names that
        may be used to specify an element. If the element may only be referred

        remove the element entirely.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the alias is used as the name in any code set, one of the
        other names will be used instead. Predicting exactly which one will be
        used requires you to know the order in which the standards were read,
        which is not reliable, so you may want to use the
        <span class="Li">&quot;rename_code&quot;</span> method to force one of
        the alternate names to be used.</p>

<p class="Pp">Each module will work with one specific type of code sets.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Locale::Codes::Country, Locale::Country</dt>
  <dd>This includes support for country codes (such as those listed in ISO-3166)

As of version 2.00, the modules supported common variants of names.
<p class="Pp">For example, Locale::Country supports variant names for countries,

   country2code('USA');

<p class="Pp">Any number of common aliases may be included in the data, in
    addition to the names that come directly from the standards. If you have a
    common alias for a country, language, or any other of the types of codes,
    let me know and I'll add it, with some restrictions.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, the country name &quot;North Korea&quot; never
    appeared in any of the official sources (instead, it was &quot;Korea,
    North&quot; or &quot;Korea, Democratic People's Republic of&quot;. I would
    honor a request to add an alias &quot;North Korea&quot; since that's a very
    common way to specify the country (please don't request this... I've already
    added it).</p>
<p class="Pp">On the other hand, a request to add Zaire as an alias for
    &quot;Congo, The Democratic Republic of&quot; will not be honored. The
    country's official name is no longer Zaire, so adding it as an alias
    violates the standard. Zaire was kept as an alias in versions of this module
    prior to 3.00, but it has been removed. Other aliases (if any) which no
    longer appear in any standard (and which are not common variations of the
    name in the standards) have also been removed.</p>

Occasionally, a code is deprecated, but it may still be desirable to have access
  to it.
<p class="Pp">Although there is no way to see every code that has ever existed
    and been deprecated (since most codesets do not have that information
    available), as of version 3.20, every code which has ever been included in
    these modules can be referenced.</p>

  <dt><b>Relationship between code sets</b></dt>
  <dd>Because each code set uses a slightly different list of elements, and they
      are not necessarily one-to-one, there may be some confusion about the
      relationship between codes from different code sets.
    <p class="Pp">For example, ISO 3166 assigns one code to the country
        &quot;United States Minor Outlying Islands&quot;, but the IANA codes
        give different codes to different islands (Baker Island, Howland Island,
        etc.).</p>

If you find a bug in Locale::Codes, there are three ways to send it to me. Any
  of them are fine, so use the method that is easiest for you.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Direct email</dt>
  <dd>You are welcome to send it directly to me by email. The email address to
      use is: sbeck@cpan.org.</dd>
  <dt>CPAN Bug Tracking</dt>
  <dd>You can submit it using the CPAN tracking too. This can be done at the
      following URL:
    <p class="Pp">&lt;http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Locale-Codes&gt;</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>GitHub</dt>
  <dd>You can submit it as an issue on GitHub. This can be done at the following
      URL:
    <p class="Pp">&lt;https://github.com/SBECK-github/Locale-Codes&gt;</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Please do not use other means to report bugs (such as forums for a
    specific OS or Linux distribution) as it is impossible for me to keep up
    with all of them.</p>
<p class="Pp">When filing a bug report, please include the following
    information:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>Locale::Codes version</b></dt>
  <dd>Please include the version of Locale::Codes you are using. You can get
      this by using the script:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
   use Locale::Codes;
   print $Locale::Codes::VERSION,&quot;\n&quot;;
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If you want to report missing or incorrect codes, you must be
    running the most recent version of Locale::Codes.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you find any problems with the documentation (errors, typos, or
    items that are not clear), please send them to me. I welcome any suggestions
    that will allow me to improve the documentation.</p>
