This man page contains the documentation for all of the extensions that are
  added to Tcl by Extended Tcl (TclX). TclX extends Tcl's capabilities by adding
  new commands to it, without changing the syntax of standard Tcl. Extended Tcl
  is a superset of standard Tcl and is built alongside the standard Tcl sources.
<p class="Pp">Extended Tcl was created by Karl Lehenbauer and Mark Diekhans and
    is freely redistributable for any use without license or fee.</p>
<p class="Pp">Available since 1989, Extended Tcl, also known as TclX, not only
    adds capabilities to Tcl, but has also been the source of many of the
    capabilities of the baseline Tcl release, including arrays, files, sockets,
    file events, and date and time handling, among others.</p>
<p class="Pp">Extended Tcl introduces a set of new commands and a
    user-extensible library of useful Tcl procedures, any of which can be
    automatically loaded on the first attempt to execute it.</p>
<p class="Pp">The command descriptions are separated into several sections:</p>

  COMMANDS</a></h1>
A set of general, useful Tcl commands, includes a command to begin an
  interactive session with Tcl, a facility for tracing execution, and a looping
  command.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>dirs</b></dt>
  <dd>This procedure lists the directories in the directory stack.</dd>
  <dt><b>commandloop </b>?<b>-async</b>? ?<b>-interactive </b><b>on | off |

    ?<b>-endcommand </b><i>cmd</i>?</dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Create an interactive command loop reading commands from stdin and writing
      results to stdout. Command loops are maybe either be blocking or event
      oriented. This command is useful for Tcl scripts that do not normally
      converse interactively with a user through a Tcl command interpreter, but
      which sometimes want to enter this mode, perhaps for debugging or user
      configuration. The command loop terminates on EOF.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The following options are available:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-async</b></dt>
  <dd>A command handler will be associated with stdin. When input is available
      on stdin, it will be read and accumulated until a full command is
      available. That command will then be evaluated. An event loop must be
      entered for input to be read and processed.</dd>
  <dt><b>-interactive on | off | tty</b></dt>
  <dd>Enable or disable interactive command mode. In interactive mode, commands
      are prompted for and the results of comments are printed. The value maybe
      any boolean value or <b>tty</b>. If <b>tty</b> is used, interactive mode
      is enabled if stdin is associated with a terminal or terminal emulator.
      The default is <b>tty</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-prompt1 </b><i>cmd</i></dt>
  <dd>If specified, <i>cmd</i> is used is evaluate and its result used for the
      main command prompt. If not specified, the command in <b>tcl_prompt1</b>
      is evaluated to output the prompt. Note the difference in behavior,
      <i>cmd</i> results is used, while <b>tcl_prompt1</b> outputs. This is to
      allow for future expansion to command loops that write to other than
      stdout.</dd>
  <dt><b>-prompt2 </b><i>cmd</i></dt>
  <dd>If specified, <i>cmd</i> is used is evaluate and its result used for the
      secondary (continuation) command prompt. If not specified, the command in
      <b>tcl_prompt2</b> is evaluated to output the prompt.</dd>
  <dt><b>-endcommand </b><i>cmd</i></dt>
  <dd>If specified, <i>cmd</i> is evaluated when the command loop
    terminates.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>for_array_keys</b> <i>var array_name code</i></dt>
  <dd>This procedure performs a foreach-style loop for each key in the named
      array. The <b>break</b> and <b>continue</b> statements work as with
      <b>foreach</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>for_recursive_glob</b> <i>var dirlist globlist code</i></dt>
  <dd>This procedure performs a foreach-style loop over recursively matched
      files. All directories in <i>dirlist</i> are recursively searched
      (breadth-first), comparing each file found against the file glob patterns
      in <b>globlist</b>. For each matched file, the variable <i>var</i> is set
      to the file path and <i>code</i> is evaluated. Symbolic links are not
      followed.</dd>
  <dt><b>loop</b> <i>var first limit ?increment? body</i></dt>
  <dd><b>Loop</b> is a looping command, similar in behavior to the Tcl
      <b>for</b> statement, except that the <b>loop</b> statement achieves
      substantially higher performance and is easier to code when the beginning
      and ending values of a loop are known, and the loop variable is to be
      incremented by a known, fixed amount every time through the loop.
    <p class="Pp">
       The <i>var</i> argument is the name of a Tcl variable that will contain
        the loop index. The loop index is set to the value specified by
        <i>first</i>. The Tcl interpreter is invoked upon <i>body</i> zero or
        more times, where <i>var</i> is incremented by <i>increment</i> every
        time through the loop, or by one if <i>increment</i> is not specified.
        <i>Increment</i> can be negative in which case the loop will count
        downwards.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When <i>var</i> reaches <i>limit</i>, the loop terminates
        without a subsequent execution of <i>body</i>. For instance, if the
        original <b>loop</b> parameters would cause <b>loop</b> to terminate,
        say <i>first</i> was one, <i>limit</i> was zero and <i>increment</i> was
        not specified or was non-negative, <i>body</i> is not executed at all
        and <b>loop</b> returns.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <i>first</i>, <i>limit</i> and <i>increment</i> are
        integer expressions. They are only evaluated once at the beginning of
        the loop.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If a <b>continue</b> command is invoked within <i>body</i>
        then any remaining commands in the current execution of <i>body</i> are
        skipped, as in the <b>for</b> command. If a <b>break</b> command is
        invoked within <i>body</i> then the <b>loop</b> command will return
        immediately. <b>Loop</b> returns an empty string.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>popd</b></dt>
  <dd>This procedure pops the top directory entry from the directory stack and
      make it the current directory.</dd>
  <dt><b>pushd</b> ?<i>dir</i>?</dt>
  <dd>This procedure pushes the current directory onto the directory stack and
      <b>cd</b> to the specified directory. If the directory is not specified,
      then the current directory is pushed, but remains unchanged.</dd>
  <dt><b>recursive_glob</b> <i>dirlist globlist</i></dt>
  <dd>This procedure returns a list of recursively matches files. All
      directories in <i>dirlist</i> are recursively searched (breadth-first),
      comparing each file found against the file glob patterns in
      <b>globlist</b>. Symbolic links are not followed.</dd>
  <dt><b>showproc </b>?<i>procname ...?</i></dt>
  <dd>This procedure lists the definition of the named procedures. Loading them
      if it is not already loaded. If no procedure names are supplied, the
      definitions of all currently loaded procedures are returned.</dd>
  <dt><b>try_eval</b> <i>code</i> <i>catch</i> ?<i>finally</i>?</dt>
  <dd>The <b>try_eval</b> command evaluates <i>code</i> in the current
    context.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If an error occurs during the evaluation and <i>catch</i> is not
    empty, then <i>catch</i> is evaluated to handler the error. The result of
    the command, containing the error message, will be stored in a global
    variable <b>errorResult</b>. The global variables <b>errorResult</b>,
    <b>errorInfo</b> and <b>errorCode</b> will be imported into the current
    scope, there is no need to execute a <b>global</b> command. The result of
    the <i>catch</i> command becomes the result of the <b>try_eval</b> command.
    If the error that caused the <i>catch</i> to be evaluate is to be continued,
    the following command should be used:
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
	<b>error $errorResult $errorCode $errorInfo</b>
</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>finally</i> argument is supplied and not empty, it is
    evaluated after the evaluation of the <i>code</i> and the <i>catch</i>
    commands. If an error occurs during the evaluation of the <i>finally</i>
    command, it becomes the result of the <b>try_eval</b> command. Otherwise,
    the result of either <i>code</i> or <i>catch</i> is preserved, as described
    above.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DEBUGGING_AND_DEVELOPMENT_COMMANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#DEBUGGING_AND_DEVELOPMENT_COMMANDS">DEBUGGING
  AND DEVELOPMENT COMMANDS</a></h1>
This section contains information on commands and procedures that are useful for
  developing and debugging Tcl scripts.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>cmdtrace</b> <i>level</i> | <b>on</b> ?<b>noeval</b>?
    ?<b>notruncate</b>? ?<i>procs</i>? ?<i>fileid</i>? ?<b>command</b><i>
    cmd</i>?</dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Print a trace statement for all commands executed at depth of <i>level</i>
      or below (1 is the top level). If <b>on</b> is specified, all commands at
      any level are traced. The following options are available:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>noeval</b></dt>
  <dd>Causes arguments to be printed unevaluated. If <b>noeval</b> is specified,
      the arguments are printed before evaluation. Otherwise, they are printed
      afterwards.
    <p class="Pp">If the command line is longer than 60 characters, it is
        truncated to 60 and a &quot;...&quot; is postpended to indicate that
        there was more output than was displayed. If an evaluated argument
        contains a space, the entire argument will be enclosed inside of braces
        (`{}') to allow the reader to visually separate the arguments from each
        other.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>notruncate</b></dt>
  <dd>Disables the truncation of commands and evaluated arguments.</dd>
  <dt><b>procs</b></dt>
  <dd>Enables the tracing of procedure calls only. Commands that aren't
      procedure calls (i.e. calls to commands that are written in C, C++ or some
      object-compatible language) are not traced if the <b>procs</b> option is
      specified. This option is particularly useful for greatly reducing the
      output of <b>cmdtrace</b> while debugging.</dd>
  <dt><b>fileid</b></dt>
  <dd>This is a file id as returned by the <b>open</b> command. If specified,
      then the trace output will be written to the file rather than stdout. A
      stdio buffer flush is done after every line is written so that the trace
      may be monitored externally or provide useful information for debugging
      problems that cause core dumps.</dd>
  <dt><b>command</b> <i>cmd</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Call the specified command <i>cmd</i> on when each command is executed
      instead of tracing to a file. See the description of the functionally
      below. This option may not be specified with a <b>fileid</b>.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The most common use of this command is to enable tracing to a file during
      the development. If a failure occurs, a trace is then available when
      needed. Command tracing will slow down the execution of code, so it should
      be removed when code is debugged. The following command will enable
      tracing to a file for the remainder of the program:</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
    <pre>
<span class="Li"></span><span class="Li">	cmdtrace on [open cmd.log w]</span>
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The <b>command</b> option causes a user specified trace command to be
      called for each command executed. The command will have the following
      arguments appended to it before evaluation:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>command</i></dt>
  <dd>A string containing the text of the command, before any argument
      substitution.</dd>
  <dt><i>argv</i></dt>
  <dd>A list of the final argument information that will be passed to the
      command after command, variable, and backslash substitution.</dd>
  <dt><i>evalLevel</i></dt>
  <dd>The <b>Tcl_Eval</b> call level.</dd>
  <dt><i>procLevel</i></dt>
  <dd>The procedure call level.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The command should be constructed in such a manner that it will work if
      additional arguments are added in the future. It is suggested that the
      command be a <b>proc</b> with the final argument being <b>args</b>.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Tracing will be turned off while the command is being executed. The values
      of the <b>errorInfo</b> and <b>errorCode</b> variables will be saved and
      restored on return from the command. It is the command's responsibility to
      preserve all other state.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>If an error occurs during the execution of <b>command</b>, an error
      message is dumped to stderr and the tracing is disabled. The underlying
      mechanism that this functionality is built on does not support returning
      an error to the interpreter.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>cmdtrace off</b></dt>
  <dd>Turn off all tracing.</dd>
  <dt><b>cmdtrace depth</b></dt>
  <dd>Returns the current maximum trace level, or zero if trace is
    disabled.</dd>
  <dt><b>edprocs </b>?<i>proc</i>...?</dt>
  <dd>This procedure writes the named procedures, or all currently defined
      procedures, to a temporary file, then calls an editor on it (as specified
      by the <b>EDITOR</b> environment variable, or <b>vi</b> if none is
      specified), then sources the file back in if it was changed.</dd>
  <dt><b>profile</b> ?<i>-commands</i>? ?<i>-eval</i>? <b>on</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>profile off</b> <i>arrayVar</i></dt>
  <dd>This command is used to collect a performance profile of a Tcl script. It
      collects data at the Tcl procedure level. The number of calls to a
      procedure, and the amount of real and CPU time is collected. Time is also
      collected for the global context. The procedure data is collected by
      bucketing it based on the procedure call stack, this allows determination
      of how much time is spent in a particular procedure in each of it's
      calling contexts.
    <p class="Pp">The <b>on</b> option enables profile data collection. If the
        <b>-commands</b> option is specified, data on all commands within a
        procedure is collected as well a procedures. Multiple occurrences of a
        command within a procedure are not distinguished, but this data may
        still be useful for analysis.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <b>off</b> option turns off profiling and moves the data
        collected to the array <i>arrayVar</i>. The array is address by a list
        containing the procedure call stack. Element zero is the top of the
        stack, the procedure that the data is for. The data in each entry is a
        list consisting of the procedure call count and the real time and CPU
        time in milliseconds spent in the procedure (but not any procedures it
        calls). The list is in the form {<i>count real cpu</i>}.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Normally, the variable scope stack is used in reporting where
        time is spent. Thus upleveled code is reported in the context that it
        was executed in, not the context that the uplevel was called in. If the
        <b>-eval</b> option is specified, the procedure evaluation (call) stack
        is used instead of the procedure scope stack. Upleveled code is reported
        in the context of the procedure that did the uplevel.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A Tcl procedure <b>profrep</b> is supplied for reducing the
        data and producing a report.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On <b>Windows</b>, profile command only reports elapsed real
        time, CPU time is not available and is reported as zero.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>profrep</b> <i>profDataVar sortKey</i> ?<i>outFile</i>?
    ?<i>userTitle</i>?</dt>
  <dd>This procedure generates a report from data collect from the profile
      command. <b>ProfDataVar</b> is the name of the array containing the data
      returned by the <b>profile</b> command. <b>SortKey</b> indicates which
      data value to sort by. It should be one of &quot;<b>calls</b>&quot;,
      &quot;<b>cpu</b>&quot; or &quot;<b>real</b>&quot;. <b>OutFile</b> is the
      name of file to write the report to. If omitted, stdout is assumed.
      <b>UserTitle</b> is an optional title line to add to output.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Listed with indentation below each procedure or command is the procedure
      call stack. The first indented line being the procedure that invoked the

  <dt><b>alarm</b> <i>seconds</i></dt>
  <dd>Instructs the system to send a SIGALRM signal in the specified number of
      seconds. This is a floating point number, so fractions of a section may be
      specified. If <i>seconds</i> is 0.0, any previous alarm request is
      canceled. Only one alarm at a time may be active; the command returns the
      number of seconds left in the previous alarm. On systems without the

      passing the arguments in the list <i>arglist</i>.
    <p class="Pp">The <b>-argv0</b> options specifies that <i>argv0</i> is to be
        passed to the program as argv [0] rather than <i>prog</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note: If you are using <b>execl</b> in a Tk application and it
        fails, you may not do anything that accesses the X server or you will
        receive a <b>BadWindow</b> error from the X server. This includes
        executing the Tk version of the <b>exit</b> command. We suggest using

  COMMANDS</a></h1>
These commands provide extended file access and manipulation. This includes
  searching ASCII-sorted data files, copying files, duplicating file
  descriptors, control of file access options, retrieving open file status, and
  creating pipes with the <b>pipe</b> system call. Also linking files, setting
  file, process, and user attributes and truncating files. An interface to the
  <b>select</b> system call is available on Unix systems that support it.
<p class="Pp">It should be noted that Tcl file I/O is implemented on top of the
    stdio library. By default, the file is buffered. When communicating to a
    process through a pipe, a <b>flush</b> command should be issued to force the
    data out. Alternatively, the <b>fcntl</b> command may be used to set the
    buffering mode of a file to line-buffered or unbuffered.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>bsearch</b> <i>fileId key</i> ?<i>retvar</i>?

  <dd>
    <br/>
    Search an opened file <i>fileId</i> containing lines of text sorted into
      ascending order for a match. <i>Key</i> contains the string to match. If
      <i>retvar</i> is specified, then the line from the file is returned in
      <i>retvar</i>, and the command returns <b>1</b> if <i>key</i> was found,
      and <b>0</b> if it wasn't. If <i>retvar</i> is not specified or is a null
      name, then the command returns the line that was found, or an empty string
      if <i>key</i> wasn't found.
    <p class="Pp">By default, the key is matched against the first white-space
        separated field in each line. The field is treated as an ASCII string.
        If <i>compare_proc</i> is specified, then it defines the name of a Tcl
        procedure to evaluate against each line read from the sorted file during
        the execution of the <b>bsearch</b> command. <i>Compare_proc</i> takes
        two arguments, the key and a line extracted from the file. The compare
        routine should return a number less than zero if the key is less than
        the line, zero if the key matches the line, or greater than zero if the
        key is greater than the line. The file must be sorted in ascending order
        according to the same criteria <i>compare_proc</i> uses to compare the
        key with the line, or erroneous results will occur.</p>

        checked if the specified files are clear for writing. The
        <i>exceptFileIds</i> are checked to see if an exceptional condition has
        occurred (typically, an error). The write and exception checking is most
        useful on devices, however, the read checking is very useful when
        communicating with multiple processes through pipes. Select considers

<h1 class="Sh" id="FILE_SCANNING_COMMANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#FILE_SCANNING_COMMANDS">FILE
  SCANNING COMMANDS</a></h1>
These commands provide a facility to scan files, matching lines of the file
  against regular expressions and executing Tcl code on a match. With this
  facility you can use Tcl to do the sort of file processing that is
  traditionally done with <i>awk</i>. And since Tcl's approach is more
  declarative, some of the scripts that can be rather difficult to write in awk
  are simple to code in Tcl.
<p class="Pp">File scanning in Tcl centers around the concept of a <i>scan
    context</i>. A scan context contains one or more match statements, which
    associate regular expressions to scan for with Tcl code to be executed when
    the expressions are matched.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>scancontext</b> ?<i>option</i>?</dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    This command manages file scan contexts. A scan context is a collection of
      regular expressions and commands to execute when that regular expression
      matches a line of the file. A context may also have a single default
      match, to be applied against lines that do not match any of the regular
      expressions. Multiple scan contexts may be defined and they may be reused
      on multiple files. A scan context is identified by a context handle. The
      <b>scancontext</b> command takes the following forms:</dd>
  <dt><b>scancontext create</b></dt>
  <dd>Create a new scan context. The <b>scanmatch</b> command is used to define
      patterns in the context. A contexthandle is returned, which the Tcl
      programmer uses to refer to the newly created scan context in calls to the
      Tcl file scanning commands.</dd>
  <dt><b>scancontext delete</b> <i>contexthandle</i></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Delete the scan context identified by <i>contexthandle</i>, and free all of
      the match statements and compiled regular expressions associated with the
      specified context.</dd>
  <dt><b>scancontext copyfile</b> <i>contexthandle</i> ?<i>filehandle</i>?</dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Set or return the file handle that unmatched lines are copied to. (See
      <b>scanfile</b>). If <i>filehandle</i> is omitted, the copy file handle is
      returned. If no copy file is associated with the context, {} is returned.
      If a file handle is specified, it becomes the copy file for this context.
      If <i>filehandle</i> is {}, then it removes any copy file specification
      for the context.</dd>
  <dt><b>scanfile</b> ?<i>-copyfile copyFileId</i>? <i>contexthandle</i>
    <i>fileId</i></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Scan the file specified by <i>fileId</i>, starting from the current file
      position. Check all patterns in the scan context specified by
      <i>contexthandle</i> against it, executing the match commands
      corresponding to patterns matched.
    <p class="Pp">If the optional <i>-copyfile</i> argument is specified, the
        next argument is a file ID to which all lines not matched by any pattern
        (excluding the default pattern) are to be written. If the copy file is
        specified with this flag, instead of using the <b>scancontext
        copyfile</b> command, the file is disassociated from the scan context at
        the end of the scan.</p>

        (bytes of zero).</p>

      specified for a give context. <i>Regexp</i> is a regular expression (see
      the <b>regexp</b> command). If <b>-nocase</b> is specified as the first

<h1 class="Sh" id="KEYED_LISTS"><a class="permalink" href="#KEYED_LISTS">KEYED
  LISTS</a></h1>
Extended Tcl defines a special type of list referred to as <i>keyed lists</i>.
  These lists provided a structured data type built upon standard Tcl lists.
  This provides a functionality similar to <i>struct</i>s in the C programming
  language.
<p class="Pp">A keyed list is a list in which each element contains a key and
    value pair. These element pairs are stored as lists themselves, where the
    key is the first element of the list, and the value is the second. The
    key-value pairs are referred to as <i>fields</i>. This is an example of a
    keyed list:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
     {{NAME {Frank Zappa}} {JOB {musician and composer}}}</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If the variable <b>person</b> contained the above list, then
    <b>keylget person NAME</b> would return <b>{Frank Zappa}</b>. Executing the
    command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
<span class="Li"></span><span class="Li">	keylset person ID 106</span>
</pre>
<p class="Pp">would make <b>person</b> contain</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
     {{ID 106} {NAME {Frank Zappa}} {JOB {musician and composer}}</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Fields may contain subfields; `.' is the separator character.
    Subfields are actually fields where the value is another keyed list. Thus
    the following list has the top level fields <i>ID</i> and <i>NAME</i>, and
    subfields <i>NAME.FIRST</i> and <i>NAME.LAST</i>:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
     {ID 106} {NAME {{FIRST Frank} {LAST Zappa}}}</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">There is no limit to the recursive depth of subfields, allowing
    one to build complex data structures.</p>
<p class="Pp">Keyed lists are constructed and accessed via a number of commands.
    All keyed list management commands take the name of the variable containing
    the keyed list as an argument (i.e. passed by reference), rather than
    passing the list directly.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>keyldel</b> <i>listvar</i> <i>key</i></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Delete the field specified by <i>key</i> from the keyed list in the variable
      <i>listvar</i>. This removes both the key and the value from the keyed
      list.</dd>
  <dt><b>keylget</b> <i>listvar</i> ?<i>key</i>? ?<i>retvar</i> | {}?</dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Return the value associated with <i>key</i> from the keyed list in the
      variable <i>listvar</i>. If <i>retvar</i> is not specified, then the value
      will be returned as the result of the command. In this case, if <i>key</i>
      is not found in the list, an error will result.
    <p class="Pp">If <i>retvar</i> is specified and <i>key</i> is in the list,
        then the value is returned in the variable <i>retvar</i> and the command
        returns <b>1</b> if the key was present within the list. If <i>key</i>
        isn't in the list, the command will return <b>0</b>, and <i>retvar</i>
        will be left unchanged. If <b>{}</b> is specified for <i>retvar</i>, the
        value is not returned, allowing the Tcl programmer to determine if a key
        is present in a keyed list without setting a variable as a
      side-effect.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <i>key</i> is omitted, then a list of all the keys in the
        keyed list is returned.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>keylkeys</b> <i>listvar</i> ?<i>key</i>?</dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Return the a list of the keys in the keyed list in the variable
      <i>listvar</i>. If <i>keys</i> is specified, then it is the name of a key
      field who's subfield keys are to be retrieve.</dd>
  <dt><b>keylset</b> <i>listvar</i> <i>key</i> <i>value</i> ?<i>key2</i>
    <i>value2</i> ...?</dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Set the value associated with <i>key</i>, in the keyed list contained in the
      variable <i>listvar</i>, to <i>value</i>. If listvar does not exists, it
      is created. If <i>key</i> is not currently in the list, it will be added.
      If it already exists, <i>value</i> replaces the existing value. Multiple
      keywords and values may be specified, if desired.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="STRING_AND_CHARACTER_MANIPULATION_COMMANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#STRING_AND_CHARACTER_MANIPULATION_COMMANDS">STRING

The commands provide additional functionality to classify characters, convert
  characters between character and numeric values, index into a string,
  determine the length of a string, extract a range of character from a string,
  replicate a string a number of times, and transliterate a string (similar to
  the Unix <i>tr</i> program).

    that are language-independent. Through the use of message catalogs, prompts,
    messages, menus and so forth can exist for any number of languages, and they
    can altered, and new languages added, without affecting any Tcl or C source
    code, greatly easing the maintenance difficulties incurred by supporting
    multiple languages.</p>
<p class="Pp">A default text message is passed to the command that fetches
    entries from message catalogs. This allows the Tcl programmer to create
    message catalogs containing messages in various languages, but still have a
    set of default messages available regardless of the presence of any message
    catalogs, and allow the programs to press on without difficulty when no
    catalogs are present.</p>
<p class="Pp">Thus, the normal approach to using message catalogs is to ignore
    errors on <b>catopen</b>, in which case <b>catgets</b> will return the
    default message that was specified in the call.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Tcl message catalog commands normally ignore most errors. If
    it is desirable to detect errors, a special option is provided. This is
    normally used only during debugging, to insure that message catalogs are
    being used. If your Unix implementation does not have XPG/3 message catalog
    support, stubs will be compiled in that will create a version of
    <b>catgets</b> that always returns the default string. This allows for easy
    porting of software to environments that don't have support for message
    catalogs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Message catalogs are global to the process, an application with
    multiple Tcl interpreters within the same process may pass and share message
    catalog handles.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>catopen</b> ?<b>-fail</b> | <b>-nofail</b>? <i>catname</i></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Open the message catalog <i>catname</i>. This may be a relative path name,
      in which case the <b>NLSPATH</b> environment variable is searched to find
      an absolute path to the message catalog. A handle in the form
      <b>msgcat</b> <i>N</i> is returned. Normally, errors are ignored, and in
      the case of a failed call to <b>catopen</b>, a handle is returned to an
      unopened message catalog. (This handle may still be passed to
      <b>catgets</b> and <b>catclose</b>, causing <b>catgets</b> to simply
      return the default string, as described above. If the <b>-fail</b> option
      is specified, an error is returned if the open fails. The option
      <b>-nofail</b> specifies the default behavior of not returning an error
      when <b>catopen</b> fails to open a specified message catalog. If the
      handle from a failed <b>catopen</b> is passed to <b>catgets</b>, the
      default string is returned.</dd>
  <dt><b>catgets</b> <i>catHandle setnum msgnum defaultstr</i></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Retrieve a message form a message catalog. <i>CatHandle</i> should be a Tcl
      message catalog handle that was returned by <b>catopen</b>. <i>Setnum</i>
      is the message set number, and <i>msgnum</i> is the message number. If the
      message catalog was not opened, or the message set or message number
      cannot be found, then the default string, <i>defaultstr</i>, is
    returned.</dd>
  <dt><b>catclose</b> ?<b>-fail</b> | <b>-nofail</b>? <i>cathandle</i></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Close the message catalog specified by <i>cathandle</i>. Normally, errors
      are ignored. If <b>-fail</b> is specified, any errors closing the message
      catalog file are returned. The option <b>-nofail</b> specifies the default
      behavior of not returning an error. The use of <b>-fail</b> only makes
      sense if it was also specified in the call to <b>catopen</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>mainloop</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    This procedure sets up a top-level event loop. Events are processed until
      there are no more active event sources, at which time the process exits.
      It is used to build event oriented programs using the TclX shell in a
      style similar to that used with <b>wish</b>. If the global variable
      <b>tcl_interactive</b> exists and has a true value an interactive command
      handler is started as well. If the command handler is terminated by an
      EOF, the process will be exited.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="HELP_FACILITY"><a class="permalink" href="#HELP_FACILITY">HELP
  FACILITY</a></h1>
The help facility allows one to look up help pages which where extracted from
  the standard Tcl manual pages and Tcl scripts during Tcl installation. Help
  files are structured as a multilevel tree of subjects and help pages. Help
  files are found by searching directories named <b>help</b> in the directories
  listed in the <b>auto_path</b> variable. All of the files in the list of help
  directories form a virtual root of the help tree. This method allows multiple
  applications to provide help trees without having the files reside in the same
  directory.
<p class="Pp">The help facility can be accessed in two ways, as interactive
    commands in the Extended Tcl shell or as an interactive Tk-based program (if
    you have built Extended Tcl with Tk).</p>
<p class="Pp">To run the Tk-based interactive help program:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
<span class="Li"></span>
<span class="Li">    tclhelp ?addpaths?</span>
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Where <i>addpaths</i> are additional paths to search for help
    directories. By default, only the <i>auto_path</i> used by <b>tclhelp</b> is
    search. This will result in help on Tcl, Extended Tcl and Tk.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following interactive Tcl commands and options are provided
    with the help package:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>help</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Help, without arguments, lists of all the help subjects and pages under the
      current help subject.</dd>
  <dt><b>help</b> <i>subject</i></dt>
  <dd>Displays all of help pages and lower level subjects (if any exist) under
      the subject <i>subject</i>.</dd>
  <dt><b>help</b> <i>subject/helppage</i></dt>
  <dd>Display the specified help page. The help output is passed through a
      simple pager if output exceeds 23 lines, pausing waiting for a return to
      be entered. If any other character is entered, the output is
    terminated.</dd>
  <dt><b>helpcd</b> ?<i>subject</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Change the current subject, which is much like the Unix current directory.
      If <i>subject</i> is not specified, return to the top-level of the help
      tree. Help subject path names may also include ``..'' elements.</dd>
  <dt><b>helppwd</b></dt>
  <dd>Displays the current help subject.</dd>
  <dt><b>help</b> <i>help</i> | ?</dt>
  <dd>Displays help on the help facility at any directory level.</dd>
  <dt><b>apropos</b> <i>pattern</i></dt>
  <dd>This command locates subjects by searching their one-line descriptions for
      a pattern. Apropos is useful when you can remember part of the name or
      description of a command, and want to search through the one-line
      summaries for matching lines. Full regular expressions may be specified
      (see the <b>regexp</b> command).</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="TCL_LOADABLE_LIBRARIES_AND_PACKAGES"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_LOADABLE_LIBRARIES_AND_PACKAGES">TCL
  LOADABLE LIBRARIES AND PACKAGES</a></h1>
Extended Tcl supports standard Tcl <b>tclIndex</b> libraries and package
  libraries. A package library file can contain multiple independent Tcl
  packages. A package is a named collection of related Tcl procedures and
  initialization code.
<p class="Pp">The package library file is just a regular Unix text file,
    editable with your favorite text editor, containing packages of Tcl source
    code. The package library file name must have the suffix <b>.tlib</b>. An
    index file with the same prefix name and the suffix <b>.tndx</b> resides the
    same directory as the <b>.tlib</b> file. The <b>.tndx</b> will be
    automatically created whenever it is out of date or missing (provided there
    is write access to the directory).</p>
<p class="Pp">The variable <b>auto_path</b> contains a list of directories that
    are searched for libraries. The first time an unknown command trap is take,
    the indexes for the libraries are loaded into memory. If the
    <b>auto_path</b> variable is changed during execution of a program, it will
    be re-searched. Only the first package of a given name found during the
    execution of a program is loaded. This can be overridden with
    <b>loadlibindex</b> command.</p>
<p class="Pp">The start of a package is delimited by:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><b>#@package</b>: <i>package_name proc1</i> ?<i>..procN</i>?</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">These lines must start in column one. Everything between the
    <b>#@package:</b> keyword and the next <b>#@package:</b> keyword or a
    <b>#@packend</b> keyword, or the end of the file, becomes part of the named
    package. The specified procedures, <i>proc1..procN</i>, are the entry points
    of the package. When a command named in a package specification is executed
    and detected as an unknown command, all code in the specified package will
    be sourced. This package should define all of the procedures named on the
    package line, define any support procedures required by the package and do
    any package-specific initialization. Packages declarations maybe continued
    on subsequent lines using standard Tcl backslash line continuations. The
    <b>#@packend</b> keyword is useful to make sure only the minimum required
    section of code is sourced. Thus for example a large comment block at the
    beginning of the next file won't be loaded.</p>
<p class="Pp">Care should be taken in defining <i>package_name</i>, as the first
    package found in the path by with a given name is loaded. This can be useful
    in developing new version of packages installed on the system.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, in a package source file, the presence of the
    following line:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><b>#@package: directory_stack pushd popd dirs</b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">says that the text lines following that line in the package file
    up to the next <i>package</i> line or the end of the file is a package named
    <b>directory_stack</b> and that an attempt to execute either <i>pushd</i>,
    <i>popd</i> or <i>dirs</i> when the routine is not already defined will
    cause the <b>directory_stack</b> portion of the package file to be
  loaded.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="PACKAGE_LIBRARY_MANAGEMENT_COMMANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#PACKAGE_LIBRARY_MANAGEMENT_COMMANDS">PACKAGE
  LIBRARY MANAGEMENT COMMANDS</a></h1>
Several commands are available for building and managing package libraries.
  Commands that are extended versions of the standard Tcl library commands are
  listed here. All of the standard Tcl library management commands and variables
  are also supported.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>auto_commands</b> ?<b>-loaders</b>?</dt>
  <dd>Lists the names of all known loadable procedures and commands procedures.
      If <b>-loaders</b> is specified, the command that will be executed to load
      the command will also be returned.</dd>
  <dt><b>buildpackageindex</b> <i>libfilelist</i></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Build index files for package libraries. The argument <i>libfilelist</i> is
      a list of package libraries. Each name must end with the suffix
      <b>.tlib</b>. A corresponding <b>.tndx</b> file will be built. The user
      must have write access to the directory containing each library.</dd>
  <dt><b>convert_lib</b> <i>tclIndex packagelib ?ignore?</i></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Convert a Ousterhout style <i>tclIndex</i> index file and associate source
      files into a package library <b>packagelib</b>. If <b>packagelib</b> does
      not have a <b>.tlib</b> extension, one will be added. Any files specified
      in <i>tclIndex</i> that are in the list <i>ignore</i> will be skipped.
      Files listed in <i>ignore</i> should just be the base file names, not full
      paths.</dd>
  <dt><b>loadlibindex</b> <i>libfile.tlib</i></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Load the package library index of the library file <b>libfile</b> (which
      must have the suffix <i>.tlib</i>). Package library indexes along the
      <b>auto_path</b> are loaded automatically on the first <b>demand_load</b>;
      this command is provided to explicitly load libraries that are not in the
      path. If the index file (with a <i>.tndx</i> suffix) does not exists or is
      out of date, it will be rebuilt if the user has directory permissions to
      create it. If a package with the same name as a package in
      <i>libfile.tlib</i> has already been loaded, its definition will be
      overridden by the new package. However, if any procedure has actually been
      used from the previously defined package, the procedures from
      <i>libfile.tlib</i> will not be loaded.</dd>
  <dt><b>auto_packages</b> ?<i>-location</i>?</dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Returns a list of the names of all defined packages. If <i>-location</i> is
      specified, a list of pairs of package name and the <b>.tlib</b> path name,
      offset and length of the package within the library.</dd>
  <dt><b>auto_load_file</b> <i>file</i></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Source a file, as with the <b>source</b> command, except search
      <b>auto_path</b> for the file.</dd>
  <dt><b>searchpath</b> <i>path file</i></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    Search all directories in the specified path, which is a Tcl list, for the
      specified file. Returns the full path name of the file, or an empty string
      if the requested file could not be found.
