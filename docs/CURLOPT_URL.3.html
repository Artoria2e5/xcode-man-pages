Pass in a pointer to the <i>URL</i> to work with. The parameter should be a char
  * to a zero terminated string which must be URL-encoded in the following
  format:
<p class="Pp">scheme://host:port/path</p>
<p class="Pp">For a greater explanation of the format please see RFC3986.</p>
<p class="Pp">libcurl doesn't validate the syntax or use this variable until the
    transfer is issued. Even if you set a crazy value here,
    <i>curl_easy_setopt(3)</i> will still return <i>CURLE_OK</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the given URL is missing a scheme name (such as
    &quot;http://&quot; or &quot;ftp://&quot; etc) then libcurl will make a
    guess based on the host. If the outermost sub-domain name matches DICT, FTP,
    IMAP, LDAP, POP3 or SMTP then that protocol will be used, otherwise HTTP
    will be used. Since 7.45.0 guessing can be disabled by setting a default
    protocol, see <i>CURLOPT_DEFAULT_PROTOCOL(3)</i> for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">Should the protocol, either that specified by the scheme or
    deduced by libcurl from the host name, not be supported by libcurl then
    <i>CURLE_UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL</i> will be returned from either the
    <i>curl_easy_perform(3)</i> or <i>curl_multi_perform(3)</i> functions when
    you call them. Use <i>curl_version_info(3)</i> for detailed information of
    which protocols are supported by the build of libcurl you are using.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS(3)</i> can be used to limit what protocols
    libcurl will use for this transfer, independent of what libcurl has been
    compiled to support. That may be useful if you accept the URL from an
    external source and want to limit the accessibility.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>CURLOPT_URL(3)</i> string will be ignored if
    <i>CURLOPT_CURLU(3)</i> is set.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>CURLOPT_URL(3)</i> or <i>CURLOPT_CURLU(3)</i> <b>must</b> be
    set before a transfer is started.</p>
<p class="Pp">The host part of the URL contains the address of the server that
    you want to connect to. This can be the fully qualified domain name of the
    server, the local network name of the machine on your network or the IP
    address of the server or machine represented by either an IPv4 or IPv6
    address. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp">http://www.example.com/</p>
<p class="Pp">http://hostname/</p>
<p class="Pp">http://192.168.0.1/</p>
<p class="Pp">http://[2001:1890:1112:1::20]/</p>
<p class="Pp">It is also possible to specify the user name, password and any
    supported login options as part of the host, for the following protocols,
    when connecting to servers that require authentication:</p>
<p class="Pp">http://user:password@www.example.com</p>
<p class="Pp">ftp://user:password@ftp.example.com</p>
<p class="Pp">smb://domain%2fuser:password@server.example.com</p>
<p class="Pp">imap://user:password;options@mail.example.com</p>
<p class="Pp">pop3://user:password;options@mail.example.com</p>
<p class="Pp">smtp://user:password;options@mail.example.com</p>
<p class="Pp">At present only IMAP, POP3 and SMTP support login options as part
    of the host. For more information about the login options in URL syntax
    please see RFC2384, RFC5092 and IETF draft draft-earhart-url-smtp-00.txt
    (Added in 7.31.0).</p>
<p class="Pp">The port is optional and when not specified libcurl will use the
    default port based on the determined or specified protocol: 80 for HTTP, 21
    for FTP and 25 for SMTP, etc. The following examples show how to specify the
    port:</p>
<p class="Pp">http://www.example.com:8080/ - This will connect to a web server
    using port 8080 rather than 80.</p>
<p class="Pp">smtp://mail.example.com:587/ - This will connect to a SMTP server
    on the alternative mail port.</p>
<p class="Pp">The path part of the URL is protocol specific and whilst some
    examples are given below this list is not conclusive:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>HTTP</dt>
  <dd>The path part of an HTTP request specifies the file to retrieve and from
      what directory. If the directory is not specified then the web server's
      root directory is used. If the file is omitted then the default document
      will be retrieved for either the directory specified or the root
      directory. The exact resource returned for each URL is entirely dependent
      on the server's configuration.
    <p class="Pp">http://www.example.com - This gets the main page from the web
        server.</p>
    <p class="Pp">http://www.example.com/index.html - This returns the main page
        by explicitly requesting it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">http://www.example.com/contactus/ - This returns the default
        document from the contactus directory.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>FTP</dt>
  <dd>The path part of an FTP request specifies the file to retrieve and from
      what directory. If the file part is omitted then libcurl downloads the
      directory listing for the directory specified. If the directory is omitted
      then the directory listing for the root / home directory will be returned.
    <p class="Pp">ftp://ftp.example.com - This retrieves the directory listing
        for the root directory.</p>
    <p class="Pp">ftp://ftp.example.com/readme.txt - This downloads the file
        readme.txt from the root directory.</p>
    <p class="Pp">ftp://ftp.example.com/libcurl/readme.txt - This downloads
        readme.txt from the libcurl directory.</p>
    <p class="Pp">ftp://user:password@ftp.example.com/readme.txt - This
        retrieves the readme.txt file from the user's home directory. When a
        username and password is specified, everything that is specified in the
        path part is relative to the user's home directory. To retrieve files
        from the root directory or a directory underneath the root directory
        then the absolute path must be specified by prepending an additional
        forward slash to the beginning of the path.</p>
    <p class="Pp">ftp://user:password@ftp.example.com//readme.txt - This
        retrieves the readme.txt from the root directory when logging in as a
        specified user.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>SMTP</dt>
  <dd>The path part of a SMTP request specifies the host name to present during
      communication with the mail server. If the path is omitted then libcurl
      will attempt to resolve the local computer's host name. However, this may
      not return the fully qualified domain name that is required by some mail
      servers and specifying this path allows you to set an alternative name,
      such as your machine's fully qualified domain name, which you might have
      obtained from an external function such as gethostname or getaddrinfo.
    <p class="Pp">smtp://mail.example.com - This connects to the mail server at
        example.com and sends your local computer's host name in the HELO / EHLO
        command.</p>
    <p class="Pp">smtp://mail.example.com/client.example.com - This will send
        client.example.com in the HELO / EHLO command to the mail server at
        example.com.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>POP3</dt>
  <dd>The path part of a POP3 request specifies the message ID to retrieve. If
      the ID is not specified then a list of waiting messages is returned
      instead.
    <p class="Pp">pop3://user:password@mail.example.com - This lists the
        available messages for the user</p>
    <p class="Pp">pop3://user:password@mail.example.com/1 - This retrieves the
        first message for the user</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>IMAP</dt>
  <dd>The path part of an IMAP request not only specifies the mailbox to list
      (Added in 7.30.0) or select, but can also be used to check the UIDVALIDITY
      of the mailbox, to specify the UID, SECTION (Added in 7.30.0) and PARTIAL
      octets (Added in 7.37.0) of the message to fetch and to specify what
      messages to search for (Added in 7.37.0).
    <p class="Pp">imap://user:password@mail.example.com - Performs a top level
        folder list</p>
    <p class="Pp">imap://user:password@mail.example.com/INBOX - Performs a
        folder list on the user's inbox</p>
    <p class="Pp">imap://user:password@mail.example.com/INBOX/;UID=1 - Selects
        the user's inbox and fetches message with uid = 1</p>
    <p class="Pp">imap://user:password@mail.example.com/INBOX/;MAILINDEX=1 -
        Selects the user's inbox and fetches the first message in the mail
      box</p>
    <p class="Pp">imap://user:password@mail.example.com/INBOX;UIDVALIDITY=50/;UID=2
        - Selects the user's inbox, checks the UIDVALIDITY of the mailbox is 50
        and fetches message 2 if it is</p>
    <p class="Pp">imap://user:password@mail.example.com/INBOX/;UID=3/;SECTION=TEXT
        - Selects the user's inbox and fetches the text portion of message 3</p>
    <p class="Pp">imap://user:password@mail.example.com/INBOX/;UID=4/;PARTIAL=0.1024
        - Selects the user's inbox and fetches the first 1024 octets of message
        4</p>
    <p class="Pp">imap://user:password@mail.example.com/INBOX?NEW - Selects the
        user's inbox and checks for NEW messages</p>
    <p class="Pp">imap://user:password@mail.example.com/INBOX?SUBJECT%20shadows
        - Selects the user's inbox and searches for messages containing
        &quot;shadows&quot; in the subject line</p>
    <p class="Pp">For more information about the individual components of an
        IMAP URL please see RFC5092.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>SCP</dt>
  <dd>The path part of a SCP request specifies the file to retrieve and from
      what directory. The file part may not be omitted. The file is taken as an
      absolute path from the root directory on the server. To specify a path
      relative to the user's home directory on the server, prepend ~/ to the
      path portion. If the user name is not embedded in the URL, it can be set
      with the <i>CURLOPT_USERPWD(3)</i> or <i>CURLOPT_USERNAME(3)</i> option.
    <p class="Pp">scp://user@example.com/etc/issue - This specifies the file
        /etc/issue</p>
    <p class="Pp">scp://example.com/~/my-file - This specifies the file my-file
        in the user's home directory on the server</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>SFTP</dt>
  <dd>The path part of a SFTP request specifies the file to retrieve and from
      what directory. If the file part is omitted then libcurl downloads the
      directory listing for the directory specified. If the path ends in a /
      then a directory listing is returned instead of a file. If the path is
      omitted entirely then the directory listing for the root / home directory
      will be returned. If the user name is not embedded in the URL, it can be
      set with the <i>CURLOPT_USERPWD(3)</i> or <i>CURLOPT_USERNAME(3)</i>
      option.
    <p class="Pp">sftp://user:password@example.com/etc/issue - This specifies
        the file /etc/issue</p>
    <p class="Pp">sftp://user@example.com/~/my-file - This specifies the file
        my-file in the user's home directory</p>
    <p class="Pp">sftp://ssh.example.com/~/Documents/ - This requests a
        directory listing of the Documents directory under the user's home
        directory</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>SMB</dt>
  <dd>The path part of a SMB request specifies the file to retrieve and from
      what share and directory or the share to upload to and as such, may not be
      omitted. If the user name is not embedded in the URL, it can be set with
      the <i>CURLOPT_USERPWD(3)</i> or <i>CURLOPT_USERNAME(3)</i> option. If the
      user name is embedded in the URL then it must contain the domain name and
      as such, the backslash must be URL encoded as %2f.
    <p class="Pp">smb://server.example.com/files/issue - This specifies the file
        &quot;issue&quot; located in the root of the &quot;files&quot; share</p>
    <p class="Pp">smb://server.example.com/files/ -T issue - This specifies the
        file &quot;issue&quot; will be uploaded to the root of the
        &quot;files&quot; share.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>LDAP</dt>
  <dd>The path part of a LDAP request can be used to specify the: Distinguished
      Name, Attributes, Scope, Filter and Extension for a LDAP search. Each
      field is separated by a question mark and when that field is not required
      an empty string with the question mark separator should be included.
    <p class="Pp">ldap://ldap.example.com/o=My%20Organisation - This will
        perform a LDAP search with the DN as My Organisation.</p>
    <p class="Pp">ldap://ldap.example.com/o=My%20Organisation?postalAddress -
        This will perform the same search but will only return postalAddress
        attributes.</p>
    <p class="Pp">ldap://ldap.example.com/?rootDomainNamingContext - This
        specifies an empty DN and requests information about the
        rootDomainNamingContext attribute for an Active Directory server.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For more information about the individual components of a LDAP
        URL please see RFC4516.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>RTMP</dt>
  <dd>There's no official URL spec for RTMP so libcurl uses the URL syntax
      supported by the underlying librtmp library. It has a syntax where it
      wants a traditional URL, followed by a space and a series of
      space-separated name=value pairs.
    <p class="Pp">While space is not typically a &quot;legal&quot; letter,
        libcurl accepts them. When a user wants to pass in a '#' (hash)
        character it will be treated as a fragment and get cut off by libcurl if
        provided literally. You will instead have to escape it by providing it
        as backslash and its ASCII value in hexadecimal: &quot;\23&quot;.</p>

The string pointed to in the <i>CURLOPT_URL(3)</i> argument is generally

<p class="Pp">If libcurl is built with IDN support, the server name part of the
    URL can use an &quot;international name&quot; by using the current encoding

  CONCERNS</a></h1>
Applications may at times find it convenient to allow users to specify URLs for
  various purposes and that string would then end up fed to this option.
<p class="Pp">Getting a URL from an external untrusted party will bring reasons
    for several security concerns:</p>
<p class="Pp">If you have an application that runs as or in a server
    application, getting an unfiltered URL can easily trick your application to
    access a local resource instead of a remote. Protecting yourself against
    localhost accesses is very hard when accepting user provided URLs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Such custom URLs can also access other ports than you planned as
    port numbers are part of the regular URL format. The combination of a local
    host and a custom port number can allow external users to play tricks with
    your local services.</p>
<p class="Pp">Accepting external URLs may also use other protocols than http://
    or other common ones. Restrict what accept with
  <i>CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS(3)</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">User provided URLs can also be made to point to sites that
    redirect further on (possibly to other protocols too). Consider your
    <i>CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)</i> and <i>CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS(3)</i>
    settings.</p>
