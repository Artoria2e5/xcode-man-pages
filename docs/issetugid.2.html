The <code class="Fn">issetugid</code>() system call returns 1 if the process
  environment or memory address space is considered &#x201C;tainted&#x201D;, and
  returns 0 otherwise.
<p class="Pp">A process is tainted if it was created as a result of an
    <a class="Xr">execve(2)</a> system call which had either of the setuid or
    setgid bits set (and extra privileges were given as a result) or if it has
    changed any of its real, effective or saved user or group ID's since it
    began execution.</p>
<p class="Pp">This system call exists so that library routines (eg: libc,
    libtermcap) can reliably determine if it is safe to use information that was
    obtained from the user, in particular the results from
    <a class="Xr">getenv(3)</a> should be viewed with suspicion if it is used to
    control operation.</p>
<p class="Pp">A &#x201C;tainted&#x201D; status is inherited by child processes
    as a result of the <a class="Xr">fork(2)</a> system call (or other library
    code that calls fork, such as <a class="Xr">popen(3)</a>).</p>
<p class="Pp">It is assumed that a program that clears all privileges as it
    prepares to execute another will also reset the environment, hence the
    &#x201C;tainted&#x201D; status will not be passed on. This is important for
    programs such as <a class="Xr">su(1)</a> which begin setuid but need to be
    able to create an untainted process.</p>

The <code class="Fn">issetugid</code>() system call is always successful, and no
  return value is reserved to indicate an error.
