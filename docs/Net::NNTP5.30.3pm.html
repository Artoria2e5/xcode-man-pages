<span class="Li">&quot;Net::NNTP&quot;</span> is a class implementing a simple
  NNTP client in Perl as described in RFC977 and RFC4642. With IO::Socket::SSL
  installed it also provides support for implicit and explicit TLS encryption,
  i.e. NNTPS or NNTP+STARTTLS.
<p class="Pp">The Net::NNTP class is a subclass of Net::Cmd and (depending on
    avaibility) of IO::Socket::IP, IO::Socket::INET6 or IO::Socket::INET.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>new ( [ HOST ] [, OPTIONS ])</dt>
  <dd>This is the constructor for a new Net::NNTP object.
      <span class="Li">&quot;HOST&quot;</span> is the name of the remote host to
      which a NNTP connection is required. If not given then it may be passed as
      the <span class="Li">&quot;Host&quot;</span> option described below. If no
      host is passed then two environment variables are checked, first
      <span class="Li">&quot;NNTPSERVER&quot;</span> then
      <span class="Li">&quot;NEWSHOST&quot;</span>, then
      <span class="Li">&quot;Net::Config&quot;</span> is checked, and if a host
      is not found then <span class="Li">&quot;news&quot;</span> is used.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;OPTIONS&quot;</span> are passed in a
        hash like fashion, using key and value pairs. Possible options are:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Host</b> - NNTP host to connect to. It may be a single
        scalar, as defined for the <span class="Li">&quot;PeerAddr&quot;</span>
        option in IO::Socket::INET, or a reference to an array with hosts to try
        in turn. The &quot;host&quot; method will return the value which was
        used to connect to the host.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Port</b> - port to connect to. Default - 119 for plain NNTP
        and 563 for immediate SSL (nntps).</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>SSL</b> - If the connection should be done from start with
        SSL, contrary to later upgrade with
        <span class="Li">&quot;starttls&quot;</span>. You can use SSL arguments
        as documented in IO::Socket::SSL, but it will usually use the right
        arguments already.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Timeout</b> - Maximum time, in seconds, to wait for a
        response from the NNTP server, a value of zero will cause all IO
        operations to block. (default: 120)</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Debug</b> - Enable the printing of debugging information to
        STDERR</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Reader</b> - If the remote server is INN then initially the
        connection will be to innd, by default
        <span class="Li">&quot;Net::NNTP&quot;</span> will issue a
        <span class="Li">&quot;MODE READER&quot;</span> command so that the
        remote server becomes nnrpd. If the
        <span class="Li">&quot;Reader&quot;</span> option is given with a value
        of zero, then this command will not be sent and the connection will be
        left talking to innd.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>LocalAddr</b> and <b>LocalPort</b> - These parameters are
        passed directly to IO::Socket to allow binding the socket to a specific
        local address and port.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Domain</b> - This parameter is passed directly to
        IO::Socket and makes it possible to enforce IPv4 connections even if
        IO::Socket::IP is used as super class. Alternatively <b>Family</b> can
        be used.</p>

Unless otherwise stated all methods return either a <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>
  value, with <i>true</i> meaning that the operation was a success. When a
  method states that it returns a value, failure will be returned as
  <i>undef</i> or an empty list.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Net::NNTP&quot;</span> inherits from
    <span class="Li">&quot;Net::Cmd&quot;</span> so methods defined in

    the remote NNTP server in addition to the methods documented here.</p>

      must be given in <span class="Li">&quot;new&quot;</span> already.</dd>
  <dt>article ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ], [FH] )</dt>
  <dd>Retrieve the header, a blank line, then the body (text) of the specified
      article.
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;FH&quot;</span> is specified then it
        is expected to be a valid filehandle and the result will be printed to

        <span class="Li">&quot;FH&quot;</span> is not specified then the return
        value, on success, will be a reference to an array containing the
        article requested, each entry in the array will contain one line of the
        article.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If no arguments are passed then the current article in the
        currently selected newsgroup is fetched.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;MSGNUM&quot;</span> is a numeric id of
        an article in the current newsgroup, and will change the current article
        pointer. <span class="Li">&quot;MSGID&quot;</span> is the message id of
        an article as shown in that article's header. It is anticipated that the
        client will obtain the <span class="Li">&quot;MSGID&quot;</span> from a
        list provided by the <span class="Li">&quot;newnews&quot;</span>
        command, from references contained within another article, or from the

  <dt>nntpstat ( [ MSGID|MSGNUM ] )</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;nntpstat&quot;</span> command is similar to the

      returned. When selecting by message number within a group, the
      <span class="Li">&quot;nntpstat&quot;</span> command serves to set the
      &quot;current article pointer&quot; without sending text.
    <p class="Pp">Using the <span class="Li">&quot;nntpstat&quot;</span> command
        to select by message-id is valid but of questionable value, since a
        selection by message-id does <b>not</b> alter the &quot;current article

  <dt>help ( )</dt>
  <dd>Request help text (a short summary of commands that are understood by this

        to match any sequence of zero or more characters.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The second is a question mark
        <span class="Li">&quot;?&quot;</span> to match any single character. The
        third specifies a specific set of characters.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The set is specified as a list of characters, or as a range of
        characters where the beginning and end of the range are separated by a
        minus (or dash) character, or as any combination of lists and ranges.
        The dash can also be included in the set as a character it if is the
        beginning or end of the set. This set is enclosed in square brackets.
        The close square bracket <span class="Li">&quot;]&quot;</span> may be
        used in a set if it is the first character in the set.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The fourth operation is the same as the logical not of the
        third operation and is specified the same way as the third with the
        addition of a caret character <span class="Li">&quot;^&quot;</span> at
        the beginning of the test string just inside the open square
      bracket.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The final operation uses the backslash character to invalidate
        the special meaning of an open square bracket
        <span class="Li">&quot;[&quot;</span>, the asterisk, backslash or the
        question mark. Two backslashes in sequence will result in the evaluation
        of the backslash as a character with no special meaning.</p>
