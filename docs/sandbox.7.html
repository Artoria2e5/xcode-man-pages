The <code class="Nm">sandbox</code> facility allows applications to voluntarily
  restrict their access to operating system resources. This safety mechanism is
  intended to limit potential damage in the event that a vulnerability is
  exploited. It is not a replacement for other operating system access controls.
<p class="Pp">New processes inherit the <code class="Nm">sandbox</code> of their
    parent. Restrictions are generally enforced upon acquisition of operating
    system resources only. For example, if file system writes are restricted, an
    application will not be able to <a class="Xr">open(2)</a> a file for
    writing. However, if the application already has a file descriptor opened
    for writing, it may use that file descriptor regardless of restrictions.</p>
