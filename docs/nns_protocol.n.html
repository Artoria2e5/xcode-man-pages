   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   RCS: @(#) $Id: man.macros,v 1.1 2009/01/30 04:56:47 andreas_kupries Exp $
  
  	# Set up traps and other miscellaneous stuff for Tcl/Tk man pages.
  	# Start an argument description
  .b
  	# define tabbing values for .AP
  
  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location
  	# ^b = 1
  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)
  	Draw four-sided box normally, but don't draw top of
  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar
  	# Special macro to handle page bottom:  finish off current
  	# box/sidebar if in box/sidebar mode, then invoked standard
  	# page bottom macro.
  	Draw three-sided box if this is the box's first page,
  	draw two sides but no top otherwise.
  	# DS - begin display
  	# DE - end display
  	# SO - start of list of standard options
  	# SE - end of list of standard options
  	# OP - start of full description for a single option
  	# CS - begin code excerpt
  	# CE - end code excerpt

The packages <b>nameserv::server</b>, <b>nameserv</b>, and
  <b>nameserv::common</b> provide a simple unprotected name service facility for
  use in small trusted environments.
<p class="Pp">Please read <i>Name service facility, introduction</i> first.</p>
<p class="Pp">This document contains the specification of the network protocol
    which is used by client and server to talk to each other, enabling
    implementations of the same protocol in other languages.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="NANO_NAME_SERVICE_PROTOCOL_VERSION_1"><a class="permalink" href="#NANO_NAME_SERVICE_PROTOCOL_VERSION_1">NANO
  NAME SERVICE PROTOCOL VERSION 1</a></h1>
This protocol defines the basic set of messages to be supported by a name
  service, also called the <i>Core</i> feature.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="BASIC_LAYER"><a class="permalink" href="#BASIC_LAYER">BASIC
  LAYER</a></h2>
The basic communication between client and server is done using the
  remote-execution protocol specified by the Tcl package <b>comm</b>. The
  relevant document specifying its on-the-wire protocol can be found in
  <i>comm_wire</i>.
<p class="Pp">All the scripts exchanged via this protocol are single commands in
    list form and thus can be interpreted as plain messages instead of as Tcl
    commands. The commands/messages specified in the next section are the only
    commands understood by the server-side. Command and variable substitutions
    are not allowed within the messages, i.e. arguments have to be literal
    values.</p>
<p class="Pp">The protocol is synchronous. I.e. for each message sent a response
    is expected, and has to be generated. All messages are sent by the client.
    The server does not sent messages, only responses to messages.</p>

  LAYER</a></h2>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>Bind</b> <i>name</i> <i>data</i></dt>
  <dd>The client sends this message when it registers itself at the service with
      a <i>name</i> and some associated <i>data</i>. The server has to send an
      error response if the <i>name</i> is already in use. Otherwise the
      response has to be an empty string.
    <p class="Pp">The server has to accept multiple names for the same
      client.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Release</b></dt>
  <dd>The client sends this message to unregister all names it is known under at
      the service. The response has to be an empty string, always.</dd>
  <dt><b>Search</b> <i>pattern</i></dt>
  <dd>The client sends this message to search the service for names matching the
      glob-<i>pattern</i>. The response has to be a dictionary containing the
      matching names as keys, and mapping them to the data associated with it at
      <b>Bind</b>-time.</dd>
  <dt><b>ProtocolVersion</b></dt>
  <dd>The client sends this message to query the service for the highest version
      of the name service protocol it supports. The response has to be a
      positive integer number.
    <p class="Pp">Servers supporting only <i>Nano Name Service Protocol Version
        1</i> have to return <b>1</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>ProtocolFeatures</b></dt>
  <dd>The client sends this message to query the service for the features of the
      name service protocol it supports. The response has to be a list
      containing feature names.
    <p class="Pp">Servers supporting only <i>Nano Name Service Protocol Version
        1</i> have to return <b>{Core}</b>.</p>

  NAME SERVICE PROTOCOL EXTENSION: CONTINUOUS SEARCH</a></h1>
This protocol defines an extended set of messages to be supported by a name
  service, also called the <i>Search/Continuous</i> feature. This feature
  defines additional messages between client and server, and is otherwise
  identical to version 1 of the protocol. See the last section for the details
  of our foundation.
<p class="Pp">A service supporting this feature has to put the feature name
    <b>Search/Continuous</b> into the list of features returned by the message
    <i>ProtocolFeatures</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">For this extension the protocol is asynchronous. No direct
    response is expected for any of the messages in the extension. Furthermore
    the server will start sending messages on its own, instead of only responses
    to messages, and the client has to be able to handle these
  notifications.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>Search/Continuous/Start</b> <i>tag</i> <i>pattern</i></dt>
  <dd>The client sends this message to start searching the service for names
      matching the glob-<i>pattern</i>. In contrast to the regular <i>Search</i>
      request this one asks the server to continuously monitor the database for
      the addition and removal of matching entries and to notify the client of
      all such changes. The particular search is identified by the <i>tag</i>.
    <p class="Pp">No direct response is expected, rather the clients expect to
        be notified of changes via explicit <i>Search/Continuous/Result</i>
        messages generated by the service.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It is further expected that the <i>tag</i> information is
        passed unchanged to the <i>Search/Continuous/Result</i> messages. This
        tagging of the results enables clients to start multiple searches and
        distinguish between the different results.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Search/Continuous/Stop</b> <i>tag</i></dt>
  <dd>The client sends this message to stop the continuous search identified by
      the <i>tag</i>.</dd>
  <dt><b>Search/Continuous/Change</b> <i>tag</i> <b>add</b>|<b>remove</b>
    <i>response</i></dt>
  <dd>This message is sent by the service to clients with active continuous
      searches to transfer found changes. The first such message for a new
      continuous search has to contains the current set of matching entries.
    <p class="Pp">To ensure this a service has to generate an <b>add</b>-message
        with an empty <i>response</i> if there were no matching entries at the
        time.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <i>response</i> has to be a dictionary containing the
        matching names as keys, and mapping them to the data associated with it
        at <b>Bind</b>-time. The argument coming before the response tells the
        client whether the names in the response were added or removed from the
        service.</p>
