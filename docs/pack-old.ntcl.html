   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<i>Note: this manual entry describes the syntax for the </i><b>pack</b><i></i>
  <i>command as it existed before Tk version 3.3.</i> <i>Although this syntax
  continues to be supported for backward</i> <i>compatibility, it is obsolete
  and should not be used anymore.</i> <i>At some point in the future it may
  cease to be supported.</i>
<p class="Pp">The packer is a geometry manager that arranges the children of a
    parent by packing them in order around the edges of the parent. The first
    child is placed against one side of the window, occupying the entire span of
    the window along that side. This reduces the space remaining for other
    children as if the side had been moved in by the size of the first child.
    Then the next child is placed against one side of the remaining cavity, and
    so on until all children have been placed or there is no space left in the
    cavity.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>before</b>, <b>after</b>, and <b>append</b> forms of the
    <b>pack</b> command are used to insert one or more children into the packing
    order for their parent. The <b>before</b> form inserts the children before
    window <i>sibling</i> in the order; all of the other windows must be
    siblings of <i>sibling</i>. The <b>after</b> form inserts the windows after
    <i>sibling</i>, and the <b>append</b> form appends one or more windows to
    the end of the packing order for <i>parent</i>. If a <i>window</i> named in
    any of these commands is already packed in its parent, it is removed from
    its current position in the packing order and repositioned as indicated by
    the command. All of these commands return an empty string as result.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>unpack</b> form of the <b>pack</b> command removes
    <i>window</i> from the packing order of its parent and unmaps it. After the
    execution of this command the packer will no longer manage <i>window</i>'s
    geometry.</p>
<p class="Pp">The placement of each child is actually a four-step process; the
    <i>options</i> argument following each <i>window</i> consists of a list of
    one or more fields that govern the placement of that window. In the
    discussion below, the term <i>cavity</i> refers to the space left in a
    parent when a particular child is placed (i.e. all the space that was not
    claimed by earlier children in the packing order). The term <i>parcel</i>
    refers to the space allocated to a particular child; this is not necessarily
    the same as the child window's final geometry.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first step in placing a child is to determine which side of
    the cavity it will lie against. Any one of the following options may be used
    to specify a side:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>top</b></dt>
  <dd>Position the child's parcel against the top of the cavity, occupying the
      full width of the cavity.</dd>
  <dt><b>bottom</b></dt>
  <dd>Position the child's parcel against the bottom of the cavity, occupying
      the full width of the cavity.</dd>
  <dt><b>left</b></dt>
  <dd>Position the child's parcel against the left side of the cavity, occupying
      the full height of the cavity.</dd>
  <dt><b>right</b></dt>
  <dd>Position the child's parcel against the right side of the cavity,
      occupying the full height of the cavity.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">At most one of these options should be specified for any given
    window. If no side is specified, then the default is <b>top</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second step is to decide on a parcel for the child. For
    <b>top</b> and <b>bottom</b> windows, the desired parcel width is normally
    the cavity width and the desired parcel height is the window's requested
    height, as passed to <b>Tk_GeometryRequest</b>. For <b>left</b> and
    <b>right</b> windows, the desired parcel height is normally the cavity
    height and the desired width is the window's requested width. However, extra
    space may be requested for the window using any of the following
  options:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>padx </b><i>num</i></dt>
  <dd>Add <i>num</i> pixels to the window's requested width before computing the
      parcel size as described above.</dd>
  <dt><b>pady </b><i>num</i></dt>
  <dd>Add <i>num</i> pixels to the window's requested height before computing
      the parcel size as described above.</dd>
  <dt><b>expand</b></dt>
  <dd>This option requests that the window's parcel absorb any extra space left
      over in the parent's cavity after packing all the children. The amount of
      space left over depends on the sizes requested by the other children, and
      may be zero. If several windows have all specified <b>expand</b> then the
      extra width will be divided equally among all the <b>left</b> and
      <b>right</b> windows that specified <b>expand</b> and the extra height
      will be divided equally among all the <b>top</b> and <b>bottom</b> windows
      that specified <b>expand</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If the desired width or height for a parcel is larger than the
    corresponding dimension of the cavity, then the cavity's dimension is used
    instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third step in placing the window is to decide on the window's
    width and height. The default is for the window to receive either its
    requested width and height or the those of the parcel, whichever is smaller.
    If the parcel is larger than the window's requested size, then the following
    options may be used to expand the window to partially or completely fill the
    parcel:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>fill</b></dt>
  <dd>Set the window's size to equal the parcel size.</dd>
  <dt><b>fillx</b></dt>
  <dd>Increase the window's width to equal the parcel's width, but retain the
      window's requested height.</dd>
  <dt><b>filly</b></dt>
  <dd>Increase the window's height to equal the parcel's height, but retain the
      window's requested width.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The last step is to decide the window's location within its
    parcel. If the window's size equals the parcel's size, then the window
    simply fills the entire parcel. If the parcel is larger than the window,
    then one of the following options may be used to specify where the window
    should be positioned within its parcel:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>frame center</b></dt>
  <dd>Center the window in its parcel. This is the default if no framing option
      is specified.</dd>
  <dt><b>frame n</b></dt>
  <dd>Position the window with its top edge centered on the top edge of the
      parcel.</dd>
  <dt><b>frame ne</b></dt>
  <dd>Position the window with its upper-right corner at the upper-right corner
      of the parcel.</dd>
  <dt><b>frame e</b></dt>
  <dd>Position the window with its right edge centered on the right edge of the
      parcel.</dd>
  <dt><b>frame se</b></dt>
  <dd>Position the window with its lower-right corner at the lower-right corner
      of the parcel.</dd>
  <dt><b>frame s</b></dt>
  <dd>Position the window with its bottom edge centered on the bottom edge of
      the parcel.</dd>
  <dt><b>frame sw</b></dt>
  <dd>Position the window with its lower-left corner at the lower-left corner of
      the parcel.</dd>
  <dt><b>frame w</b></dt>
  <dd>Position the window with its left edge centered on the left edge of the
      parcel.</dd>
  <dt><b>frame nw</b></dt>
  <dd>Position the window with its upper-left corner at the upper-left corner of
      the parcel.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The packer manages the mapped/unmapped state of all the packed
    children windows. It automatically maps the windows when it packs them, and
    it unmaps any windows for which there was no space left in the cavity.</p>
<p class="Pp">The packer makes geometry requests on behalf of the parent windows
    it manages. For each parent window it requests a size large enough to
    accommodate all the options specified by all the packed children, such that
    zero space would be leftover for <b>expand</b> options.</p>
