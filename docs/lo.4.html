The <code class="Nm">loop</code> interface is a software loopback mechanism
  which may be used for performance analysis, software testing, and/or local
  communication. As with other network interfaces, the loopback interface must
  have network addresses assigned for each address family with which it is to be
  used. These addresses may be set or changed with the
  <code class="Dv">SIOCSIFADDR</code> <a class="Xr">ioctl(2)</a>. The loopback
  interface should be the last interface configured, as protocols may use the
  order of configuration as an indication of priority. The loopback should
  <i class="Em">never</i> be configured first unless no hardware interfaces
  exist.

Previous versions of the system enabled the loopback interface automatically,
  using a nonstandard Internet address (127.1). Use of that address is now
  discouraged; a reserved host address for the local network should be used
  instead.
