The Access Logging overlay can be used to record all accesses to a given backend
  database on another database. This allows all of the activity on a given
  database to be reviewed using arbitrary LDAP queries, instead of just logging
  to local flat text files. Configuration options are available for selecting a
  subset of operation types to log, and to automatically prune older log records
  from the logging database. Log records are stored with audit schema (see
  below) to assure their readability whether viewed as LDIF or in raw form.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="permalink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
These <b>slapd.conf</b> options apply to the Access Logging overlay. They should
  appear after the <b>overlay</b> directive.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>logdb &lt;suffix&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify the suffix of a database to be used for storing the log records.
      The specified database must be defined elsewhere in the configuration. The
      access controls on the log database should prevent general access. The
      suffix entry of the log database will be created automatically by this
      overlay. The log entries will be generated as the immediate children of
      the suffix entry.</dd>
  <dt><b>logops &lt;operations&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify which types of operations to log. The valid operation types are
      abandon, add, bind, compare, delete, extended, modify, modrdn, search, and
      unbind. Aliases for common sets of operations are also available:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>writes</b></dt>
  <dd>add, delete, modify, modrdn</dd>
  <dt><b>reads</b></dt>
  <dd>compare, search</dd>
  <dt><b>session</b></dt>
  <dd>abandon, bind, unbind</dd>
  <dt><b>all</b></dt>
  <dd>all operations</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>logbase &lt;operations&gt; &lt;baseDN&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify a set of operations that will only be logged if they occur under a
      specific subtree of the database. The operation types are as above for the
      <b>logops</b> setting, and delimited by a '|' character.</dd>
  <dt><b>logold &lt;filter&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify a filter for matching against Deleted and Modified entries. If the
      entry matches the filter, the old contents of the entry will be logged
      along with the current request.</dd>
  <dt><b>logoldattr &lt;attr&gt; ...</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify a list of attributes whose old contents are always logged in
      Modify and ModRDN requests. Usually only the contents of attributes that
      were actually modified will be logged; by default no old attributes are
      logged for ModRDN requests.</dd>
  <dt><b>logpurge &lt;age&gt; &lt;interval&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Specify the maximum age for log entries to be retained in the database,
      and how often to scan the database for old entries. Both the <b>age</b>
      and <b>interval</b> are specified as a time span in days, hours, minutes,
      and seconds. The time format is [ddd+]hh:mm[:ss] i.e., the days and
      seconds components are optional but hours and minutes are required. Except
      for days, which can be up to 5 digits, each numeric field must be exactly
      two digits. For example</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>logpurge 2+00:00 1+00:00</dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
</div>
would specify that the log database should be scanned every day for old entries,
  and entries older than two days should be deleted. When using a log database
  that supports ordered indexing on generalizedTime attributes, specifying an eq
  index on the <b>reqStart</b> attribute will greatly benefit the performance of
  the purge operation.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>logsuccess TRUE | FALSE</b></dt>
  <dd>If set to TRUE then log records will only be generated for successful
      requests, i.e., requests that produce a result code of 0 (LDAP_SUCCESS).
      If FALSE, log records are generated for all requests whether they succeed
      or not. The default is FALSE.

The <b>accesslog</b> overlay utilizes the &quot;audit&quot; schema described
  herein. This schema is specifically designed for <b>accesslog</b> auditing and
  is not intended to be used otherwise. It is also noted that the schema
  described here is <i>a work in</i> <i>progress</i>, and hence subject to
  change without notice. The schema is loaded automatically by the overlay.
<p class="Pp">The schema includes a number of object classes and associated
    attribute types as described below.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is a basic <b>auditObject</b> class from which two
    additional classes, <b>auditReadObject</b> and <b>auditWriteObject</b> are
    derived. Object classes for each type of LDAP operation are further derived
    from these classes. This object class hierarchy is designed to allow
    flexible yet efficient searches of the log based on either a specific
    operation type's class, or on more general classifications. The definition
    of the <b>auditObject</b> class is as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">( 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.1
 NAME 'auditObject'
 DESC 'OpenLDAP request auditing'
 SUP top STRUCTURAL
 MUST ( reqStart $ reqType $ reqSession )
 MAY ( reqDN $ reqAuthzID $ reqControls $ reqRespControls $
 reqEnd $ reqResult $ reqMessage $ reqReferral ) )</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that all of the OIDs used in the logging schema currently
    reside under the OpenLDAP Experimental branch. It is anticipated that they
    will migrate to a Standard branch in the future.</p>
<p class="Pp">An overview of the attributes follows: <b>reqStart</b> and
    <b>reqEnd</b> provide the start and end time of the operation, respectively.
    They use generalizedTime syntax. The <b>reqStart</b> attribute is also used
    as the RDN for each log entry.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>reqType</b> attribute is a simple string containing the
    type of operation being logged, e.g. <b>add</b>, <b>delete</b>,
    <b>search</b>, etc. For extended operations, the type also includes the OID
    of the extended operation, e.g. <b>extended(1.1.1.1)</b></p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>reqSession</b> attribute is an implementation-specific
    identifier that is common to all the operations associated with the same
    LDAP session. Currently this is slapd's internal connection ID, stored in
    decimal.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>reqDN</b> attribute is the distinguishedName of the target
    of the operation. E.g., for a Bind request, this is the Bind DN. For an Add
    request, this is the DN of the entry being added. For a Search request, this
    is the base DN of the search.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>reqAuthzID</b> attribute is the distinguishedName of the
    user that performed the operation. This will usually be the same name as was
    established at the start of a session by a Bind request (if any) but may be
    altered in various circumstances.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>reqControls</b> and <b>reqRespControls</b> attributes carry
    any controls sent by the client on the request and returned by the server in
    the response, respectively. The attribute values are just uninterpreted
    octet strings.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>reqResult</b> attribute is the numeric LDAP result code of
    the operation, indicating either success or a particular LDAP error code. An
    error code may be accompanied by a text error message which will be recorded
    in the <b>reqMessage</b> attribute.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>reqReferral</b> attribute carries any referrals that were
    returned with the result of the request.</p>
<p class="Pp">Operation-specific classes are defined with additional attributes
    to carry all of the relevant parameters associated with the operation:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

 NAME 'auditAdd'
 DESC 'Add operation'
 SUP auditWriteObject STRUCTURAL
 MUST reqMod )</div>
<p class="Pp">The <b>Add</b> class inherits from the <b>auditWriteObject</b>
    class. The Add and Modify classes are very similar. The <b>reqMod</b>
    attribute carries all of the attributes of the original entry being added.
    (Or in the case of a Modify operation, all of the modifications being
    performed.) The values are formatted as</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>attribute:&lt;+|-|=|#&gt; [ value]</dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
</div>
<br/>
Where '+' indicates an Add of a value, '-' for Delete, '=' for Replace, and '#'
  for Increment. In an Add operation, all of the reqMod values will have the '+'
  designator.
<p class="Pp"></p>

 NAME 'auditBind'
 DESC 'Bind operation'
 SUP auditObject STRUCTURAL

<p class="Pp">The <b>Bind</b> class includes the <b>reqVersion</b> attribute
    which contains the LDAP protocol version specified in the Bind as well as
    the <b>reqMethod</b> attribute which contains the Bind Method used in the
    Bind. This will be the string <b>SIMPLE</b> for LDAP Simple Binds or
    <b>SASL(&lt;mech&gt;)</b> for SASL Binds. Note that unless configured as a
    global overlay, only Simple Binds using DNs that reside in the current
    database will be logged.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <b>Modify</b> operation contains a description of
    modifications in the <b>reqMod</b> attribute, which was already described
    above in the Add operation. It may optionally contain the previous contents
    of any modified attributes in the <b>reqOld</b> attribute, using the same
    format as described above for the Delete operation. The <b>reqOld</b>
    attribute is only populated if the entry being modified matches the

    Boolean value showing <b>TRUE</b> if the old RDN was deleted from the entry,
    or <b>FALSE</b> if the old RDN was preserved. The <b>reqNewSuperior</b>
    attribute carries the DN of the new parent entry if the request specified
    the new parent. The <b>reqOld</b> attribute is only populated if the entry
    being modified matches the configured <b>logold</b> filter and contains

<p class="Pp">For the <b>Search</b> class the <b>reqScope</b> attribute contains
    the scope of the original search request, using the values specified for the
    LDAP URL format. I.e. <b>base</b>, <b>one</b>, <b>sub</b>, or <b>subord</b>.
    The <b>reqDerefAliases</b> attribute is one of <b>never</b>, <b>finding</b>,
    <b>searching</b>, or <b>always</b>, denoting how aliases will be processed
    during the search. The <b>reqAttrsOnly</b> attribute is a Boolean value
    showing <b>TRUE</b> if only attribute names were requested, or <b>FALSE</b>
    if attributes and their values were requested. The <b>reqFilter</b>
    attribute carries the filter used in the search request. The <b>reqAttr</b>
    attribute lists the requested attributes if specific attributes were
