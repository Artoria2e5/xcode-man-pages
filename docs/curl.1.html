<b>curl</b> is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the
  supported protocols (DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS,
  LDAP, LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS,
  TELNET and TFTP). The command is designed to work without user interaction.
<p class="Pp">curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user
    authentication, FTP upload, HTTP post, SSL connections, cookies, file
    transfer resume, Metalink, and more. As you will see below, the number of
    features will make your head spin!</p>
<p class="Pp">curl is powered by libcurl for all transfer-related features. See
    <i>libcurl(3)</i> for details.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="URL"><a class="permalink" href="#URL">URL</a></h1>
The URL syntax is protocol-dependent. You'll find a detailed description in RFC
  3986.
<p class="Pp">You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs by writing part
    sets within braces as in:</p>
<p class="Pp">
   http://site.{one,two,three}.com</p>
<p class="Pp">or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as
  in:</p>
<p class="Pp">
   ftp://ftp.example.com/file[1-100].txt</p>
<p class="Pp">
   ftp://ftp.example.com/file[001-100].txt (with leading zeros)</p>
<p class="Pp">
   ftp://ftp.example.com/file[a-z].txt</p>
<p class="Pp">Nested sequences are not supported, but you can use several ones
    next to each other:</p>
<p class="Pp">
   http://example.com/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html</p>
<p class="Pp">You can specify any amount of URLs on the command line. They will
    be fetched in a sequential manner in the specified order. You can specify
    command line options and URLs mixed and in any order on the command
  line.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth
    number or letter:</p>
<p class="Pp">
   http://example.com/file[1-100:10].txt</p>
<p class="Pp">
   http://example.com/file[a-z:2].txt</p>
<p class="Pp">When using [] or {} sequences when invoked from a command line
    prompt, you probably have to put the full URL within double quotes to avoid
    the shell from interfering with it. This also goes for other characters
    treated special, like for example '&amp;', '?' and '*'.</p>
<p class="Pp">Provide the IPv6 zone index in the URL with an escaped percentage
    sign and the interface name. Like in</p>
<p class="Pp">
   http://[fe80::3%25eth0]/</p>
<p class="Pp">If you specify URL without protocol:// prefix, curl will attempt
    to guess what protocol you might want. It will then default to HTTP but try
    other protocols based on often-used host name prefixes. For example, for
    host names starting with &quot;ftp.&quot; curl will assume you want to speak
    FTP.</p>
<p class="Pp">curl will do its best to use what you pass to it as a URL. It is
    not trying to validate it as a syntactically correct URL by any means but is
    instead <b>very</b> liberal with what it accepts.</p>
<p class="Pp">curl will attempt to re-use connections for multiple file
    transfers, so that getting many files from the same server will not do
    multiple connects / handshakes. This improves speed. Of course this is only
    done on files specified on a single command line and cannot be used between
    separate curl invokes.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PROGRESS_METER"><a class="permalink" href="#PROGRESS_METER">PROGRESS
  METER</a></h1>
curl normally displays a progress meter during operations, indicating the amount
  of transferred data, transfer speeds and estimated time left, etc. The
  progress meter displays number of bytes and the speeds are in bytes per
  second. The suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are 1024 based. For example 1k is 1024
  bytes. 1M is 1048576 bytes.
<p class="Pp">curl displays this data to the terminal by default, so if you
    invoke curl to do an operation and it is about to write data to the
    terminal, it <i>disables</i> the progress meter as otherwise it would mess
    up the output mixing progress meter and response data.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want a progress meter for HTTP POST or PUT requests, you
    need to redirect the response output to a file, using shell redirect (&gt;),
    <i>-o, --output</i> or similar.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is not the same case for FTP upload as that operation does not
    spit out any response data to the terminal.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you prefer a progress &quot;bar&quot; instead of the regular
    meter, <i>-#, --progress-bar</i> is your friend. You can also disable the
    progress meter completely with the <i>-s, --silent</i> option.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
Options start with one or two dashes. Many of the options require an additional
  value next to them.
<p class="Pp">The short &quot;single-dash&quot; form of the options, -d for
    example, may be used with or without a space between it and its value,
    although a space is a recommended separator. The long
    &quot;double-dash&quot; form, <i>-d, --data</i> for example, requires a
    space between it and its value.</p>
<p class="Pp">Short version options that don't need any additional values can be
    used immediately next to each other, like for example you can specify all
    the options -O, -L and -v at once as -OLv.</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, all boolean options are enabled with --<b>option</b>
    and yet again disabled with --<b>no-</b>option. That is, you use the exact
    same option name but prefix it with &quot;no-&quot;. However, in this list
    we mostly only list and show the --option version of them. (This concept
    with --no options was added in 7.19.0. Previously most options were toggled
    on/off on repeated use of the same command line option.)</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>--abstract-unix-socket &lt;path&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Connect through an abstract Unix domain socket, instead of using
      the network. Note: netstat shows the path of an abstract socket prefixed
      with '@', however the &lt;path&gt; argument should not have this leading
      character.
    <p class="Pp">Added in 7.53.0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--alt-svc &lt;file name&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(HTTPS) WARNING: this option is experiemental. Do not use in production.
    <p class="Pp">This option enables the alt-svc parser in curl. If the file
        name points to an existing alt-svc cache file, that will be used. After
        a completed transfer, the cache will be saved to the file name again if
        it has been modified.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Specifiy a &quot;&quot; file name (zero length) to avoid
        loading/saving and make curl just handle the cache in memory.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used several times, curl will load contents
        from all the files but the the last one will be used for saving.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Added in 7.64.1.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--anyauth</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Tells curl to figure out authentication method by itself, and use
      the most secure one the remote site claims to support. This is done by
      first doing a request and checking the response-headers, thus possibly
      inducing an extra network round-trip. This is used instead of setting a
      specific authentication method, which you can do with <i>--basic</i>,
      <i>--digest</i>, <i>--ntlm</i>, and <i>--negotiate</i>.
    <p class="Pp">Using <i>--anyauth</i> is not recommended if you do uploads
        from stdin, since it may require data to be sent twice and then the
        client must be able to rewind. If the need should arise when uploading
        from stdin, the upload operation will fail.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Used together with <i>-u, --user</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>--proxy-anyauth</i> and <i>--basic</i> and
        <i>--digest</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-a, --append</dt>
  <dd>(FTP SFTP) When used in an upload, this makes curl append to the target
      file instead of overwriting it. If the remote file doesn't exist, it will
      be created. Note that this flag is ignored by some SFTP servers (including
      OpenSSH).</dd>
  <dt>--basic</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication with the remote host.
      This is the default and this option is usually pointless, unless you use
      it to override a previously set option that sets a different
      authentication method (such as <i>--ntlm</i>, <i>--digest</i>, or
      <i>--negotiate</i>).
    <p class="Pp">Used together with <i>-u, --user</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>--proxy-basic</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--cacert &lt;file&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(TLS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file to verify the peer.
      The file may contain multiple CA certificates. The certificate(s) must be
      in PEM format. Normally curl is built to use a default file for this, so
      this option is typically used to alter that default file.
    <p class="Pp">curl recognizes the environment variable named
        'CURL_CA_BUNDLE' if it is set, and uses the given path as a path to a CA
        cert bundle. This option overrides that variable.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The windows version of curl will automatically look for a CA
        certs file named &#x00B4;curl-ca-bundle.crt&#x00B4;, either in the same
        directory as curl.exe, or in the Current Working Directory, or in any
        folder along your PATH.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If curl is built against the NSS SSL library, the NSS PEM
        PKCS#11 module (libnsspem.so) needs to be available for this option to
        work properly.</p>
    <p class="Pp">(iOS and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure
        Transport, then this option is supported for backward compatibility with
        other SSL engines, but it should not be set. If the option is not set,
        then curl will use the certificates in the system and user Keychain to
        verify the peer, which is the preferred method of verifying the peer's
        certificate chain.</p>
    <p class="Pp">(Schannel only) This option is supported for Schannel in
        Windows 7 or later with libcurl 7.60 or later. This option is supported
        for backward compatibility with other SSL engines; instead it is
        recommended to use Windows' store of root certificates (the default for
        Schannel).</p>
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used several times, the last one will be
        used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--capath &lt;dir&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(TLS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate directory to verify the
      peer. Multiple paths can be provided by separating them with &quot;:&quot;
      (e.g. &quot;path1:path2:path3&quot;). The certificates must be in PEM
      format, and if curl is built against OpenSSL, the directory must have been
      processed using the c_rehash utility supplied with OpenSSL. Using
      <i>--capath</i> can allow OpenSSL-powered curl to make SSL-connections
      much more efficiently than using <i>--cacert</i> if the --cacert file
      contains many CA certificates.
    <p class="Pp">If this option is set, the default capath value will be
        ignored, and if it is used several times, the last one will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--cert-status</dt>
  <dd>(TLS) Tells curl to verify the status of the server certificate by using
      the Certificate Status Request (aka. OCSP stapling) TLS extension.
    <p class="Pp">If this option is enabled and the server sends an invalid
        (e.g. expired) response, if the response suggests that the server
        certificate has been revoked, or no response at all is received, the
        verification fails.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This is currently only implemented in the OpenSSL, GnuTLS and
        NSS backends.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Added in 7.41.0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--cert-type &lt;type&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(TLS) Tells curl what type the provided client certificate is using. PEM,
      DER, ENG and P12 are recognized types. If not specified, PEM is assumed.
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used several times, the last one will be
        used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>-E, --cert</i> and <i>--key</i> and
        <i>--key-type</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-E, --cert &lt;certificate[:password]&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(TLS) Tells curl to use the specified client certificate file when getting
      a file with HTTPS, FTPS or another SSL-based protocol. The certificate
      must be in PKCS#12 format if using Secure Transport, or PEM format if
      using any other engine. If the optional password isn't specified, it will
      be queried for on the terminal. Note that this option assumes a
      &quot;certificate&quot; file that is the private key and the client
      certificate concatenated! See <i>-E, --cert</i> and <i>--key</i> to
      specify them independently.
    <p class="Pp">If curl is built against the NSS SSL library then this option
        can tell curl the nickname of the certificate to use within the NSS
        database defined by the environment variable SSL_DIR (or by default
        /etc/pki/nssdb). If the NSS PEM PKCS#11 module (libnsspem.so) is
        available then PEM files may be loaded. If you want to use a file from
        the current directory, please precede it with &quot;./&quot; prefix, in
        order to avoid confusion with a nickname. If the nickname contains
        &quot;:&quot;, it needs to be preceded by &quot;\&quot; so that it is
        not recognized as password delimiter. If the nickname contains
        &quot;\&quot;, it needs to be escaped as &quot;\\&quot; so that it is
        not recognized as an escape character.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine
        pkcs11 is available, then a PKCS#11 URI (RFC 7512) can be used to
        specify a certificate located in a PKCS#11 device. A string beginning
        with &quot;pkcs11:&quot; will be interpreted as a PKCS#11 URI. If a
        PKCS#11 URI is provided, then the <i>--engine</i> option will be set as
        &quot;pkcs11&quot; if none was provided and the <i>--cert-type</i>
        option will be set as &quot;ENG&quot; if none was provided.</p>
    <p class="Pp">(iOS and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure
        Transport, then the certificate string can either be the name of a
        certificate/private key in the system or user keychain, or the path to a
        PKCS#12-encoded certificate and private key. If you want to use a file
        from the current directory, please precede it with &quot;./&quot;
        prefix, in order to avoid confusion with a nickname.</p>
    <p class="Pp">(Schannel only) Client certificates must be specified by a
        path expression to a certificate store. (Loading PFX is not supported;
        you can import it to a store first). You can use &quot;&lt;store
        location&gt;\&lt;store name&gt;\&lt;thumbprint&gt;&quot; to refer to a
        certificate in the system certificates store, for example,
        &quot;CurrentUser\MY\934a7ac6f8a5d579285a74fa61e19f23ddfe8d7a&quot;.
        Thumbprint is usually a SHA-1 hex string which you can see in
        certificate details. Following store locations are supported:
        CurrentUser, LocalMachine, CurrentService, Services,
        CurrentUserGroupPolicy, LocalMachineGroupPolicy,
      LocalMachineEnterprise.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used several times, the last one will be
        used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>--cert-type</i> and <i>--key</i> and
        <i>--key-type</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--ciphers &lt;list of ciphers&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(TLS) Specifies which ciphers to use in the connection. The list of
      ciphers must specify valid ciphers. Read up on SSL cipher list details on
      this URL:
    <p class="Pp">
       https://curl.haxx.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html</p>
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used several times, the last one will be
        used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--compressed-ssh</dt>
  <dd>(SCP SFTP) Enables built-in SSH compression. This is a request, not an
      order; the server may or may not do it.
    <p class="Pp">Added in 7.56.0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--compressed</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Request a compressed response using one of the algorithms curl
      supports, and save the uncompressed document. If this option is used and
      the server sends an unsupported encoding, curl will report an error.</dd>
  <dt>-K, --config &lt;file&gt;</dt>
  <dd>
    <p class="Pp">Specify a text file to read curl arguments from. The command
        line arguments found in the text file will be used as if they were
        provided on the command line.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Options and their parameters must be specified on the same
        line in the file, separated by whitespace, colon, or the equals sign.
        Long option names can optionally be given in the config file without the
        initial double dashes and if so, the colon or equals characters can be
        used as separators. If the option is specified with one or two dashes,
        there can be no colon or equals character between the option and its
        parameter.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the parameter is to contain whitespace, the parameter must
        be enclosed within quotes. Within double quotes, the following escape
        sequences are available: \\, \&quot;, \t, \n, \r and \v. A backslash
        preceding any other letter is ignored. If the first column of a config
        line is a '#' character, the rest of the line will be treated as a
        comment. Only write one option per physical line in the config file.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Specify the filename to <i>-K, --config</i> as '-' to make
        curl read the file from stdin.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that to be able to specify a URL in the config file, you
        need to specify it using the <i>--url</i> option, and not by simply
        writing the URL on its own line. So, it could look similar to this:</p>
    <p class="Pp">url = &quot;https://curl.haxx.se/docs/&quot;</p>
    <p class="Pp">When curl is invoked, it (unless <i>-q, --disable</i> is used)
        checks for a default config file and uses it if found. The default
        config file is checked for in the following places in this order:</p>
    <p class="Pp">1) curl tries to find the &quot;home dir&quot;: It first
        checks for the CURL_HOME and then the HOME environment variables.
        Failing that, it uses getpwuid() on Unix-like systems (which returns the
        home dir given the current user in your system). On Windows, it then
        checks for the APPDATA variable, or as a last resort the
        '%USERPROFILE%\Application Data'.</p>
    <p class="Pp">2) On windows, if there is no _curlrc file in the home dir, it
        checks for one in the same dir the curl executable is placed. On
        Unix-like systems, it will simply try to load .curlrc from the
        determined home dir.</p>

  <dt>--connect-timeout &lt;seconds&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Maximum time in seconds that you allow curl's connection to take. This
      only limits the connection phase, so if curl connects within the given
      period it will continue - if not it will exit. Since version 7.32.0, this

    <p class="Pp">For a request to the given HOST1:PORT1 pair, connect to

        servers. This option is only used to establish the network connection.
        It does NOT affect the hostname/port that is used for TLS/SSL (e.g. SNI,
        certificate verification) or for the application protocols.
        &quot;HOST1&quot; and &quot;PORT1&quot; may be the empty string, meaning

        host/port&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A &quot;host&quot; specified to this option is compared as a
        string, so it needs to match the name used in request URL. It can be
        either numerical such as &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; or the full host name
        such as &quot;example.org&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This option can be used many times to add many connect
      rules.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>--resolve</i> and <i>-H, --header</i>. Added in

  </dd>
  <dt>-C, --continue-at &lt;offset&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Continue/Resume a previous file transfer at the given offset. The given
      offset is the exact number of bytes that will be skipped, counting from
      the beginning of the source file before it is transferred to the
      destination. If used with uploads, the FTP server command SIZE will not be
      used by curl.
    <p class="Pp">Use &quot;-C -&quot; to tell curl to automatically find out
        where/how to resume the transfer. It then uses the given output/input
        files to figure that out.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used several times, the last one will be
        used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>-r, --range</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-c, --cookie-jar &lt;filename&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Specify to which file you want curl to write all cookies after a
      completed operation. Curl writes all cookies from its in-memory cookie
      storage to the given file at the end of operations. If no cookies are
      known, no data will be written. The file will be written using the
      Netscape cookie file format. If you set the file name to a single dash,
      &quot;-&quot;, the cookies will be written to stdout.
    <p class="Pp">This command line option will activate the cookie engine that
        makes curl record and use cookies. Another way to activate it is to use
        the <i>-b, --cookie</i> option.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the cookie jar can't be created or written to, the whole
        curl operation won't fail or even report an error clearly. Using <i>-v,
        --verbose</i> will get a warning displayed, but that is the only visible
        feedback you get about this possibly lethal situation.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used several times, the last specified file
        name will be used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-b, --cookie &lt;data|filename&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP server in the Cookie header. It is
      supposedly the data previously received from the server in a
      &quot;Set-Cookie:&quot; line. The data should be in the format
      &quot;NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2&quot;.
    <p class="Pp">If no '=' symbol is used in the argument, it is instead
        treated as a filename to read previously stored cookie from. This option
        also activates the cookie engine which will make curl record incoming
        cookies, which may be handy if you're using this in combination with the
        <i>-L, --location</i> option or do multiple URL transfers on the same
        invoke. If the file name is exactly a minus (&quot;-&quot;), curl will
        instead the contents from stdin.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The file format of the file to read cookies from should be
        plain HTTP headers (Set-Cookie style) or the Netscape/Mozilla cookie
        file format.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The file specified with <i>-b, --cookie</i> is only used as
        input. No cookies will be written to the file. To store cookies, use the
        <i>-c, --cookie-jar</i> option.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Exercise caution if you are using this option and multiple
        transfers may occur. If you use the NAME1=VALUE1; format, or in a file
        use the Set-Cookie format and don't specify a domain, then the cookie is
        sent for any domain (even after redirects are followed) and cannot be
        modified by a server-set cookie. If the cookie engine is enabled and a
        server sets a cookie of the same name then both will be sent on a future
        transfer to that server, likely not what you intended. To address these
        issues set a domain in Set-Cookie (doing that will include sub domains)
        or use the Netscape format.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used several times, the last one will be
        used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Users very often want to both read cookies from a file and
        write updated cookies back to a file, so using both <i>-b, --cookie</i>
        and <i>-c, --cookie-jar</i> in the same command line is common.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--create-dirs</dt>
  <dd>When used in conjunction with the <i>-o, --output</i> option, curl will
      create the necessary local directory hierarchy as needed. This option
      creates the dirs mentioned with the <i>-o, --output</i> option, nothing
      else. If the --output file name uses no dir or if the dirs it mentions
      already exist, no dir will be created.

  <dd>(HTTP) This is just an alias for <i>-d, --data</i>.</dd>
  <dt>--data-binary &lt;data&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) This posts data exactly as specified with no extra processing
      whatsoever.
    <p class="Pp">If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be a
        filename. Data is posted in a similar manner as <i>-d, --data</i> does,
        except that newlines and carriage returns are preserved and conversions
        are never done.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Like <i>-d, --data</i> the default content-type sent to the
        server is application/x-www-form-urlencoded. If you want the data to be
        treated as arbitrary binary data by the server then set the content-type
        to octet-stream: -H &quot;Content-Type:
      application/octet-stream&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used several times, the ones following the
        first will append data as described in <i>-d, --data</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--data-raw &lt;data&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) This posts data similarly to <i>-d, --data</i> but without the

  <dt>--data-urlencode &lt;data&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) This posts data, similar to the other <i>-d, --data</i> options
      with the exception that this performs URL-encoding.
    <p class="Pp">To be CGI-compliant, the &lt;data&gt; part should begin with a
        <i>name</i> followed by a separator and a content specification. The

        syntaxes:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>content</dt>
  <dd>This will make curl URL-encode the content and pass that on. Just be

      will then make the syntax match one of the other cases below!</dd>
  <dt>=content</dt>
  <dd>This will make curl URL-encode the content and pass that on. The preceding
      = symbol is not included in the data.</dd>
  <dt>name=content</dt>
  <dd>This will make curl URL-encode the content part and pass that on. Note
      that the name part is expected to be URL-encoded already.</dd>
  <dt>@filename</dt>
  <dd>This will make curl load data from the given file (including any
      newlines), URL-encode that data and pass it on in the POST.</dd>
  <dt>name@filename</dt>
  <dd>This will make curl load data from the given file (including any
      newlines), URL-encode that data and pass it on in the POST. The name part
      gets an equal sign appended, resulting in
      <i>name=urlencoded-file-content</i>. Note that the name is expected to be

  <dt>-d, --data &lt;data&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Sends the specified data in a POST request to the HTTP server, in
      the same way that a browser does when a user has filled in an HTML form
      and presses the submit button. This will cause curl to pass the data to
      the server using the content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
      Compare to <i>-F, --form</i>.
    <p class="Pp"><i>--data-raw</i> is almost the same but does not have a
        special interpretation of the @ character. To post data purely binary,
        you should instead use the <i>--data-binary</i> option. To URL-encode
        the value of a form field you may use <i>--data-urlencode</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If any of these options is used more than once on the same
        command line, the data pieces specified will be merged together with a
        separating &amp;-symbol. Thus, using '-d name=daniel -d skill=lousy'
        would generate a post chunk that looks like
        'name=daniel&amp;skill=lousy'.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be a
        file name to read the data from, or - if you want curl to read the data
        from stdin. Multiple files can also be specified. Posting data from a
        file named from a file like that, carriage returns and newlines will be
        stripped out. If you don't want the @ character to have a special
        interpretation use <i>--data-raw</i> instead.</p>

  </dd>
  <dt>--disable-eprt</dt>
  <dd>(FTP) Tell curl to disable the use of the EPRT and LPRT commands when
      doing active FTP transfers. Curl will normally always first attempt to use
      EPRT, then LPRT before using PORT, but with this option, it will use PORT
      right away. EPRT and LPRT are extensions to the original FTP protocol, and
      may not work on all servers, but they enable more functionality in a
      better way than the traditional PORT command.
    <p class="Pp">--eprt can be used to explicitly enable EPRT again and

  <dd>(HTTP) Maximum time in seconds that you allow curl to wait for a

      its request. By default curl will wait one second. This option accepts
      decimal values! When curl stops waiting, it will continue as if the

  <dt>--fail-early</dt>
  <dd>Fail and exit on the first detected transfer error.
    <p class="Pp">When curl is used to do multiple transfers on the command
        line, it will attempt to operate on each given URL, one by one. By
        default, it will ignore errors if there are more URLs given and the last
        URL's success will determine the error code curl returns. So early
        failures will be &quot;hidden&quot; by subsequent successful
      transfers.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Using this option, curl will instead return an error on the
        first transfer that fails, independent of the amount of URLs that are

  </dd>
  <dt>-f, --fail</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Fail silently (no output at all) on server errors. This is mostly
      done to better enable scripts etc to better deal with failed attempts. In
      normal cases when an HTTP server fails to deliver a document, it returns
      an HTML document stating so (which often also describes why and more).
      This flag will prevent curl from outputting that and return error 22.
    <p class="Pp">This method is not fail-safe and there are occasions where
        non-successful response codes will slip through, especially when
        authentication is involved (response codes 401 and 407).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--false-start</dt>
  <dd>(TLS) Tells curl to use false start during the TLS handshake. False start
      is a mode where a TLS client will start sending application data before
      verifying the server's Finished message, thus saving a round trip when
      performing a full handshake.
    <p class="Pp">This is currently only implemented in the NSS and Secure
        Transport (on iOS 7.0 or later, or OS X 10.9 or later) backends.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Added in 7.42.0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--form-string &lt;name=string&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP SMTP IMAP) Similar to <i>-F, --form</i> except that the value string
      for the named parameter is used literally. Leading '@' and '&lt;'
      characters, and the ';type=' string in the value have no special meaning.
      Use this in preference to <i>-F, --form</i> if there's any possibility
      that the string value may accidentally trigger the '@' or '&lt;' features
      of <i>-F, --form</i>.
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>-F, --form</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-F, --form &lt;name=content&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP SMTP IMAP) For HTTP protocol family, this lets curl emulate a
      filled-in form in which a user has pressed the submit button. This causes
      curl to POST data using the Content-Type multipart/form-data according to
      RFC 2388.
    <p class="Pp">For SMTP and IMAP protocols, this is the mean to compose a
        multipart mail message to transmit.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This enables uploading of binary files etc. To force the
        'content' part to be a file, prefix the file name with an @ sign. To
        just get the content part from a file, prefix the file name with the
        symbol &lt;. The difference between @ and &lt; is then that @ makes a
        file get attached in the post as a file upload, while the &lt; makes a
        text field and just get the contents for that text field from a
      file.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Tell curl to read content from stdin instead of a file by
        using - as filename. This goes for both @ and &lt; constructs. When
        stdin is used, the contents is buffered in memory first by curl to
        determine its size and allow a possible resend. Defining a part's data
        from a named non-regular file (such as a named pipe or similar) is
        unfortunately not subject to buffering and will be effectively read at
        transmission time; since the full size is unknown before the transfer
        starts, such data is sent as chunks by HTTP and rejected by IMAP.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example: send an image to an HTTP server, where 'profile' is
        the name of the form-field to which the file portrait.jpg will be the
        input:</p>
    <p class="Pp">
       curl -F profile=@portrait.jpg https://example.com/upload.cgi</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example: send a your name and shoe size in two text fields to
        the server:</p>
    <p class="Pp">
       curl -F name=John -F shoesize=11 https://example.com/</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example: send a your essay in a text field to the server. Send
        it as a plain text field, but get the contents for it from a local
      file:</p>
    <p class="Pp">
       curl -F &quot;story=&lt;hugefile.txt&quot; https://example.com/</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can also tell curl what Content-Type to use by using
        'type=', in a manner similar to:</p>
    <p class="Pp">
       curl -F &quot;web=@index.html;type=text/html&quot; example.com</p>
    <p class="Pp">or</p>
    <p class="Pp">
       curl -F &quot;name=daniel;type=text/foo&quot; example.com</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can also explicitly change the name field of a file upload

    <p class="Pp">
       curl -F &quot;file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost&quot; example.com</p>
    <p class="Pp">If filename/path contains ',' or ';', it must be quoted by

       curl -F 'file=@&quot;localfile&quot;;filename=&quot;nameinpost&quot;'
        example.com</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that if a filename/path is quoted by double-quotes, any
        double-quote or backslash within the filename must be escaped by
        backslash.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Quoting must also be applied to non-file data if it contains
        semicolons, leading/trailing spaces or leading double quotes:</p>
    <p class="Pp">
       curl -F 'colors=&quot;red; green; blue&quot;;type=text/x-myapp'
        example.com</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can add custom headers to the field by setting headers=,

    <p class="Pp">
       curl -F &quot;submit=OK;headers=\&quot;X-submit-type: OK\&quot;&quot;
        example.com</p>
    <p class="Pp">or</p>
    <p class="Pp">
       curl -F &quot;submit=OK;headers=@headerfile&quot; example.com</p>
    <p class="Pp">The headers= keyword may appear more that once and above notes
        about quoting apply. When headers are read from a file, Empty lines and
        lines starting with '#' are comments and ignored; each header can be
        folded by splitting between two words and starting the continuation line
        with a space; embedded carriage-returns and trailing spaces are
        stripped. Here is an example of a header file contents:</p>
    <p class="Pp">
       # This file contain two headers.
       X-header-1: this is a header</p>
    <p class="Pp">
       # The following header is folded.
       X-header-2: this is
       another header</p>

    <p class="Pp">To support sending multipart mail messages, the syntax is
        extended as follows:
      <br/>
      - name can be omitted: the equal sign is the first character of the
        argument,
      <br/>
      - if data starts with '(', this signals to start a new multipart: it can
        be followed by a content type specification.
      <br/>
      - a multipart can be terminated with a '=)' argument.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example: the following command sends an SMTP mime e-mail
        consisting in an inline part in two alternative formats: plain text and
        HTML. It attaches a text file:</p>
    <p class="Pp">
       curl -F '=(;type=multipart/alternative' \
       -F '=plain text message' \
       -F '= &lt;body&gt;HTML message&lt;/body&gt;;type=text/html' \
       -F '=)' -F '=@textfile.txt' ... smtp://example.com</p>
    <p class="Pp">Data can be encoded for transfer using encoder=. Available
        encodings are <i>binary</i> and <i>8bit</i> that do nothing else than
        adding the corresponding Content-Transfer-Encoding header, <i>7bit</i>
        that only rejects 8-bit characters with a transfer error,
        <i>quoted-printable</i> and <i>base64</i> that encodes data according to
        the corresponding schemes, limiting lines length to 76 characters.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example: send multipart mail with a quoted-printable text
        message and a base64 attached file:</p>
    <p class="Pp">
       curl -F '=text message;encoder=quoted-printable' \
       -F '=@localfile;encoder=base64' ... smtp://example.com</p>

  <dt>--ftp-alternative-to-user &lt;command&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(FTP) If authenticating with the USER and PASS commands fails, send this
      command. When connecting to Tumbleweed's Secure Transport server over FTPS
      using a client certificate, using &quot;SITE AUTH&quot; will tell the
      server to retrieve the username from the certificate.

  </dd>
  <dt>--ftp-create-dirs</dt>
  <dd>(FTP SFTP) When an FTP or SFTP URL/operation uses a path that doesn't
      currently exist on the server, the standard behavior of curl is to fail.
      Using this option, curl will instead attempt to create missing
      directories.

  </dd>
  <dt>--ftp-method &lt;method&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(FTP) Control what method curl should use to reach a file on an FTP(S)
      server. The method argument should be one of the following
    alternatives:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>multicwd</dt>
  <dd>curl does a single CWD operation for each path part in the given URL. For
      deep hierarchies this means very many commands. This is how RFC 1738 says
      it should be done. This is the default but the slowest behavior.</dd>
  <dt>nocwd</dt>
  <dd>curl does no CWD at all. curl will do SIZE, RETR, STOR etc and give a full
      path to the server for all these commands. This is the fastest
    behavior.</dd>
  <dt>singlecwd</dt>
  <dd>curl does one CWD with the full target directory and then operates on the
      file &quot;normally&quot; (like in the multicwd case). This is somewhat
      more standards compliant than 'nocwd' but without the full penalty of
      'multicwd'.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Added in 7.15.1.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>--ftp-pasv</dt>
  <dd>(FTP) Use passive mode for the data connection. Passive is the internal
      default behavior, but using this option can be used to override a previous
      <i>-P, --ftp-port</i> option.
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used several times, only the first one is
        used. Undoing an enforced passive really isn't doable but you must then
        instead enforce the correct <i>-P, --ftp-port</i> again.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Passive mode means that curl will try the EPSV command first
        and then PASV, unless <i>--disable-epsv</i> is used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>--disable-epsv</i>. Added in 7.11.0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-P, --ftp-port &lt;address&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(FTP) Reverses the default initiator/listener roles when connecting with
      FTP. This option makes curl use active mode. curl then tells the server to
      connect back to the client's specified address and port, while passive
      mode asks the server to setup an IP address and port for it to connect to.

    really PORT++.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since 7.19.5, you can append &quot;:[start]-[end]&quot; to the
    right of the address, to tell curl what TCP port range to use. That means
    you specify a port range, from a lower to a higher number. A single number
    works as well, but do note that it increases the risk of failure since the
    port may not be available.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also <i>--ftp-pasv</i> and <i>--disable-eprt</i>.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>--ftp-pret</dt>
  <dd>(FTP) Tell curl to send a PRET command before PASV (and EPSV). Certain FTP
      servers, mainly drftpd, require this non-standard command for directory
      listings as well as up and downloads in PASV mode.
    <p class="Pp">Added in 7.20.0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--ftp-skip-pasv-ip</dt>
  <dd>(FTP) Tell curl to not use the IP address the server suggests in its
      response to curl's PASV command when curl connects the data connection.
      Instead curl will re-use the same IP address it already uses for the
      control connection.
    <p class="Pp">This option has no effect if PORT, EPRT or EPSV is used
        instead of PASV.</p>

  </dd>
  <dt>--ftp-ssl-ccc-mode &lt;active/passive&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(FTP) Sets the CCC mode. The passive mode will not initiate the shutdown,
      but instead wait for the server to do it, and will not reply to the
      shutdown from the server. The active mode initiates the shutdown and waits
      for a reply from the server.
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>--ftp-ssl-ccc</i>. Added in 7.16.2.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--ftp-ssl-ccc</dt>
  <dd>(FTP) Use CCC (Clear Command Channel) Shuts down the SSL/TLS layer after
      authenticating. The rest of the control channel communication will be
      unencrypted. This allows NAT routers to follow the FTP transaction. The
      default mode is passive.
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>--ssl</i> and <i>--ftp-ssl-ccc-mode</i>. Added in
        7.16.1.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--ftp-ssl-control</dt>
  <dd>(FTP) Require SSL/TLS for the FTP login, clear for transfer. Allows secure
      authentication, but non-encrypted data transfers for efficiency. Fails the
      transfer if the server doesn't support SSL/TLS.
    <p class="Pp">Added in 7.16.0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-G, --get</dt>
  <dd>When used, this option will make all data specified with <i>-d,
      --data</i>, <i>--data-binary</i> or <i>--data-urlencode</i> to be used in
      an HTTP GET request instead of the POST request that otherwise would be
      used. The data will be appended to the URL with a '?' separator.
    <p class="Pp">If used in combination with <i>-I, --head</i>, the POST data
        will instead be appended to the URL with a HEAD request.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used several times, only the first one is
        used. This is because undoing a GET doesn't make sense, but you should
        then instead enforce the alternative method you prefer.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-g, --globoff</dt>
  <dd>This option switches off the &quot;URL globbing parser&quot;. When you set
      this option, you can specify URLs that contain the letters {}[] without
      having them being interpreted by curl itself. Note that these letters are
      not normal legal URL contents but they should be encoded according to the
      URI standard.</dd>
  <dt>--happy-eyeballs-timeout-ms &lt;milliseconds&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Happy eyeballs is an algorithm that attempts to connect to both IPv4 and
      IPv6 addresses for dual-stack hosts, preferring IPv6 first for the number
      of milliseconds. If the IPv6 address cannot be connected to within that
      time then a connection attempt is made to the IPv4 address in parallel.
      The first connection to be established is the one that is used.
    <p class="Pp">The range of suggested useful values is limited. Happy
        Eyeballs RFC 6555 says &quot;It is RECOMMENDED that connection attempts
        be paced 150-250 ms apart to balance human factors against network
        load.&quot; libcurl currently defaults to 200 ms. Firefox and Chrome
        currently default to 300 ms.</p>

        used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Added in 7.59.0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--haproxy-protocol</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Send a HAProxy PROXY protocol v1 header at the beginning of the
      connection. This is used by some load balancers and reverse proxies to
      indicate the client's true IP address and port.
    <p class="Pp">This option is primarily useful when sending test requests to
        a service that expects this header.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Added in 7.60.0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-I, --head</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP FTP FILE) Fetch the headers only! HTTP-servers feature the command
      HEAD which this uses to get nothing but the header of a document. When
      used on an FTP or FILE file, curl displays the file size and last
      modification time only.</dd>
  <dt>-H, --header &lt;header/@file&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Extra header to include in the request when sending HTTP to a
      server. You may specify any number of extra headers. Note that if you
      should add a custom header that has the same name as one of the internal
      ones curl would use, your externally set header will be used instead of
      the internal one. This allows you to make even trickier stuff than curl
      would normally do. You should not replace internally set headers without
      knowing perfectly well what you're doing. Remove an internal header by
      giving a replacement without content on the right side of the colon, as
      in: -H &quot;Host:&quot;. If you send the custom header with no-value then
      its header must be terminated with a semicolon, such as -H
      &quot;X-Custom-Header;&quot; to send &quot;X-Custom-Header:&quot;.
    <p class="Pp">curl will make sure that each header you add/replace is sent
        with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus <b>not</b> add that
        as a part of the header content: do not add newlines or carriage
        returns, they will only mess things up for you.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Starting in 7.55.0, this option can take an argument in
        @filename style, which then adds a header for each line in the input
        file. Using @- will make curl read the header file from stdin.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See also the <i>-A, --user-agent</i> and <i>-e, --referer</i>
        options.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Starting in 7.37.0, you need <i>--proxy-header</i> to send
        custom headers intended for a proxy.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <p class="Pp">
       curl -H &quot;X-First-Name: Joe&quot; http://example.com/</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>WARNING</b>: headers set with this option will be set in
        all requests - even after redirects are followed, like when told with
        <i>-L, --location</i>. This can lead to the header being sent to other
        hosts than the original host, so sensitive headers should be used with
        caution combined with following redirects.</p>

  </dd>
  <dt>--limit-rate &lt;speed&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Specify the maximum transfer rate you want curl to use - for both
      downloads and uploads. This feature is useful if you have a limited pipe
      and you'd like your transfer not to use your entire bandwidth. To make it
      slower than it otherwise would be.
    <p class="Pp">The given speed is measured in bytes/second, unless a suffix
        is appended. Appending 'k' or 'K' will count the number as kilobytes,
        'm' or 'M' makes it megabytes, while 'g' or 'G' makes it gigabytes.
        Examples: 200K, 3m and 1G.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you also use the <i>-Y, --speed-limit</i> option, that
        option will take precedence and might cripple the rate-limiting
        slightly, to help keeping the speed-limit logic working.</p>

  <dt>-l, --list-only</dt>
  <dd>(FTP POP3) (FTP) When listing an FTP directory, this switch forces a
      name-only view. This is especially useful if the user wants to
      machine-parse the contents of an FTP directory since the normal directory
      view doesn't use a standard look or format. When used like this, the
      option causes a NLST command to be sent to the server instead of LIST.
    <p class="Pp">Note: Some FTP servers list only files in their response to
        NLST; they do not include sub-directories and symbolic links.</p>
    <p class="Pp">(POP3) When retrieving a specific email from POP3, this switch
        forces a LIST command to be performed instead of RETR. This is
        particularly useful if the user wants to see if a specific message id
        exists on the server and what size it is.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note: When combined with <i>-X, --request</i>, this option can
        be used to send an UIDL command instead, so the user may use the email's
        unique identifier rather than it's message id to make the request.</p>

  <dt>--local-port &lt;num/range&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Set a preferred single number or range (FROM-TO) of local port numbers to

      resource that will be busy at times so setting this range to something too
      narrow might cause unnecessary connection setup failures.

  </dd>
  <dt>--location-trusted</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Like <i>-L, --location</i>, but will allow sending the name +
      password to all hosts that the site may redirect to. This may or may not
      introduce a security breach if the site redirects you to a site to which
      you'll send your authentication info (which is plaintext in the case of
      HTTP Basic authentication).
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>-u, --user</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-L, --location</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) If the server reports that the requested page has moved to a
      different location (indicated with a Location: header and a 3XX response
      code), this option will make curl redo the request on the new place. If
      used together with <i>-i, --include</i> or <i>-I, --head</i>, headers from
      all requested pages will be shown. When authentication is used, curl only
      sends its credentials to the initial host. If a redirect takes curl to a
      different host, it won't be able to intercept the user+password. See also
      <i>--location-trusted</i> on how to change this. You can limit the amount
      of redirects to follow by using the <i>--max-redirs</i> option.
    <p class="Pp">When curl follows a redirect and the request is not a plain
        GET (for example POST or PUT), it will do the following request with a
        GET if the HTTP response was 301, 302, or 303. If the response code was
        any other 3xx code, curl will re-send the following request using the
        same unmodified method.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can tell curl to not change the non-GET request method to
        GET after a 30x response by using the dedicated options for that:
        <i>--post301</i>, <i>--post302</i> and <i>--post303</i>.</p>

  <dd>Manual. Display the huge help text.</dd>
  <dt>--max-filesize &lt;bytes&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Specify the maximum size (in bytes) of a file to download. If the file
      requested is larger than this value, the transfer will not start and curl
      will return with exit code 63.
    <p class="Pp">A size modifier may be used. For example, Appending 'k' or 'K'
        will count the number as kilobytes, 'm' or 'M' makes it megabytes, while
        'g' or 'G' makes it gigabytes. Examples: 200K, 3m and 1G. (Added in
        7.58.0)</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>NOTE:</b> The file size is not always known prior to
        download, and for such files this option has no effect even if the file
        transfer ends up being larger than this given limit. This concerns both

    <p class="Pp">See also <i>--limit-rate</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--max-redirs &lt;num&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Set maximum number of redirection-followings allowed. When <i>-L,

      redirections too much. By default, the limit is set to 50 redirections.
      Set this option to -1 to make it unlimited.

  <dt>-m, --max-time &lt;seconds&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Maximum time in seconds that you allow the whole operation to take. This
      is useful for preventing your batch jobs from hanging for hours due to
      slow networks or links going down. Since 7.32.0, this option accepts
      decimal values, but the actual timeout will decrease in accuracy as the
      specified timeout increases in decimal precision.

  <dt>--metalink</dt>
  <dd>This option can tell curl to parse and process a given URI as Metalink
      file (both version 3 and 4 (RFC 5854) are supported) and make use of the
      mirrors listed within for failover if there are errors (such as the file
      or server not being available). It will also verify the hash of the file
      after the download completes. The Metalink file itself is downloaded and
      processed in memory and not stored in the local file system.
    <p class="Pp">Example to use a remote Metalink file:</p>
    <p class="Pp">
       curl --metalink http://www.example.com/example.metalink</p>
    <p class="Pp">To use a Metalink file in the local file system, use FILE
        protocol (file://):</p>
    <p class="Pp">
       curl --metalink file://example.metalink</p>
    <p class="Pp">Please note that if FILE protocol is disabled, there is no way
        to use a local Metalink file at the time of this writing. Also note that
        if <i>--metalink</i> and <i>-i, --include</i> are used together,
        --include will be ignored. This is because including headers in the
        response will break Metalink parser and if the headers are included in
        the file described in Metalink file, hash check will fail.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><i>--metalink</i> requires that the underlying libcurl was
        built to support metalink. Added in 7.27.0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--negotiate</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Enables Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication.
    <p class="Pp">This option requires a library built with GSS-API or SSPI
        support. Use <i>-V, --version</i> to see if your curl supports
        GSS-API/SSPI or SPNEGO.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When using this option, you must also provide a fake <i>-u,
        --user</i> option to activate the authentication code properly. Sending
        a '-u :' is enough as the user name and password from the <i>-u,
        --user</i> option aren't actually used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used several times, only the first one is

  <dt>--netrc-file &lt;filename&gt;</dt>
  <dd>This option is similar to <i>-n, --netrc</i>, except that you provide the
      path (absolute or relative) to the netrc file that curl should use. You
      can only specify one netrc file per invocation. If several
      <i>--netrc-file</i> options are provided, the last one will be used.
    <p class="Pp">It will abide by <i>--netrc-optional</i> if specified.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This option overrides <i>-n, --netrc</i>. Added in 7.21.5.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--netrc-optional</dt>
  <dd>Very similar to <i>-n, --netrc</i>, but this option makes the .netrc usage
      <b>optional</b> and not mandatory as the <i>-n, --netrc</i> option does.
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>--netrc-file</i>. This option overrides <i>-n,
        --netrc</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-n, --netrc</dt>
  <dd>Makes curl scan the <i>.netrc</i> (<i>_netrc</i> on Windows) file in the
      user's home directory for login name and password. This is typically used
      for FTP on Unix. If used with HTTP, curl will enable user authentication.
      See <i>netrc(5)</i> <i>ftp(1)</i> for details on the file format. Curl
      will not complain if that file doesn't have the right permissions (it
      should not be either world- or group-readable). The environment variable
      &quot;HOME&quot; is used to find the home directory.
    <p class="Pp">A quick and very simple example of how to setup a
        <i>.netrc</i> to allow curl to FTP to the machine host.domain.com with
        user name 'myself' and password 'secret' should look similar to:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>machine host.domain.com login myself password
      secret</b></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-:, --next</dt>
  <dd>Tells curl to use a separate operation for the following URL and
      associated options. This allows you to send several URL requests, each
      with their own specific options, for example, such as different user names
      or custom requests for each.
    <p class="Pp"><i>-:, --next</i> will reset all local options and only global
        ones will have their values survive over to the operation following the
        <i>-:, --next</i> instruction. Global options include <i>-v,
        --verbose</i>, <i>--trace</i>, <i>--trace-ascii</i> and
        <i>--fail-early</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For example, you can do both a GET and a POST in a single
        command line:</p>
    <p class="Pp">

  <dt>--noproxy &lt;no-proxy-list&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Comma-separated list of hosts which do not use a proxy, if one is
      specified. The only wildcard is a single * character, which matches all
      hosts, and effectively disables the proxy. Each name in this list is
      matched as either a domain which contains the hostname, or the hostname
      itself. For example, local.com would match local.com, local.com:80, and
      www.local.com, but not www.notlocal.com.
    <p class="Pp">Since 7.53.0, This option overrides the environment variables
        that disable the proxy. If there's an environment variable disabling a

  <dd>(HTTP) Tells curl to violate RFC 7231/6.4.4 and not convert POST requests
      into GET requests when following 303 redirections. A server may require a
      POST to remain a POST after a 303 redirection. This option is meaningful
      only when using <i>-L, --location</i>.
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>--post302</i> and <i>--post301</i> and <i>-L,
        --location</i>. Added in 7.26.0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--preproxy [protocol://]host[:port]</dt>
  <dd>Use the specified SOCKS proxy before connecting to an HTTP or HTTPS <i>-x,
      --proxy</i>. In such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and
      then connects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy. Hence pre proxy.
    <p class="Pp">The pre proxy string should be specified with a protocol://
        prefix to specify alternative proxy protocols. Use socks4://,
        socks4a://, socks5:// or socks5h:// to request the specific SOCKS
        version to be used. No protocol specified will make curl default to
        SOCKS4.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the port number is not specified in the proxy string, it is
        assumed to be 1080.</p>
    <p class="Pp">User and password that might be provided in the proxy string
        are URL decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in special characters
        such as @ by using %40 or pass in a colon with %3a.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used several times, the last one will be
        used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Added in 7.52.0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-#, --progress-bar</dt>
  <dd>Make curl display transfer progress as a simple progress bar instead of
      the standard, more informational, meter.
    <p class="Pp">This progress bar draws a single line of '#' characters across
        the screen and shows a percentage if the transfer size is known. For
        transfers without a known size, there will be space ship (-=o=-) that
        moves back and forth but only while data is being transferred, with a
        set of flying hash sign symbols on top.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--proto-default &lt;protocol&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Tells curl to use <i>protocol</i> for any URL missing a scheme name.
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <p class="Pp">
       curl --proto-default https ftp.mozilla.org</p>
    <p class="Pp">An unknown or unsupported protocol causes error
        <i>CURLE_UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL</i> (1).</p>
    <p class="Pp">This option does not change the default proxy protocol
      (http).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Without this option curl would make a guess based on the host,
        see <i>--url</i> for details.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Added in 7.45.0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--proto-redir &lt;protocols&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Tells curl to limit what protocols it may use on redirect. Protocols
      denied by <i>--proto</i> are not overridden by this option. See --proto
      for how protocols are represented.
    <p class="Pp">Example, allow only HTTP and HTTPS on redirect:</p>
    <p class="Pp">
       curl --proto-redir -all,http,https http://example.com</p>
    <p class="Pp">By default curl will allow all protocols on redirect except
        several disabled for security reasons: Since 7.19.4 FILE and SCP are
        disabled, and since 7.40.0 SMB and SMBS are also disabled. Specifying
        <i>all</i> or <i>+all</i> enables all protocols on redirect, including
        those disabled for security.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Added in 7.20.2.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--proto &lt;protocols&gt;</dt>

<p class="Pp">Unknown protocols produce a warning. This allows scripts to safely
    rely on being able to disable potentially dangerous protocols, without
    relying upon support for that protocol being built into curl to avoid an

  <dt>--proxy-header &lt;header/@file&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Extra header to include in the request when sending HTTP to a

      option to <i>-H, --header</i> but is for proxy communication only like in
      CONNECT requests when you want a separate header sent to the proxy to what
      is sent to the actual remote host.
    <p class="Pp">curl will make sure that each header you add/replace is sent
        with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thus <b>not</b> add that
        as a part of the header content: do not add newlines or carriage
        returns, they will only mess things up for you.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Headers specified with this option will not be included in

  <dt>--proxy-pinnedpubkey &lt;hashes&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(TLS) Tells curl to use the specified public key file (or hashes) to

      public key in PEM or DER format, or any number of base64 encoded sha256
      hashes preceded by &#x00B4;sha256//&#x00B4; and separated by
      &#x00B4;;&#x00B4;
    <p class="Pp">When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection, the server sends a

        colon with this option: &quot;-U :&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On systems where it works, curl will hide the given option
        argument from process listings. This is not enough to protect
        credentials from possibly getting seen by other users on the same system
        as they will still be visible for a brief moment before cleared. Such
        sensitive data should be retrieved from a file instead or similar and
        never used in clear text in a command line.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used several times, the last one will be

  <dt>-x, --proxy [protocol://]host[:port]</dt>
  <dd>Use the specified proxy.
    <p class="Pp">The proxy string can be specified with a protocol:// prefix.
        No protocol specified or http:// will be treated as HTTP proxy. Use
        socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or socks5h:// to request a specific
        SOCKS version to be used. (The protocol support was added in curl
        7.21.7)</p>
    <p class="Pp">HTTPS proxy support via https:// protocol prefix was added in
        7.52.0 for OpenSSL, GnuTLS and NSS.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Unrecognized and unsupported proxy protocols cause an error
        since 7.52.0. Prior versions may ignore the protocol and use http://
        instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the port number is not specified in the proxy string, it is
        assumed to be 1080.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This option overrides existing environment variables that set
        the proxy to use. If there's an environment variable setting a proxy,
        you can set proxy to &quot;&quot; to override it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">All operations that are performed over an HTTP proxy will
        transparently be converted to HTTP. It means that certain protocol
        specific operations might not be available. This is not the case if you
        can tunnel through the proxy, as one with the <i>-p, --proxytunnel</i>
        option.</p>
    <p class="Pp">User and password that might be provided in the proxy string
        are URL decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in special characters
        such as @ by using %40 or pass in a colon with %3a.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The proxy host can be specified the exact same way as the
        proxy environment variables, including the protocol prefix (http://) and
        the embedded user + password.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used several times, the last one will be

  <dt>--proxy1.0 &lt;host[:port]&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Use the specified HTTP 1.0 proxy. If the port number is not specified, it
      is assumed at port 1080.
    <p class="Pp">The only difference between this and the HTTP proxy option
        <i>-x, --proxy</i>, is that attempts to use CONNECT through the proxy
        will specify an HTTP 1.0 protocol instead of the default HTTP 1.1.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-p, --proxytunnel</dt>
  <dd>When an HTTP proxy is used <i>-x, --proxy</i>, this option will make curl
      tunnel through the proxy. The tunnel approach is made with the HTTP proxy
      CONNECT request and requires that the proxy allows direct connect to the
      remote port number curl wants to tunnel through to.
    <p class="Pp">To suppress proxy CONNECT response headers when curl is set to
        output headers use <i>--suppress-connect-headers</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>-x, --proxy</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--pubkey &lt;key&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(SFTP SCP) Public key file name. Allows you to provide your public key in
      this separate file.
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used several times, the last one will be
        used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">(As of 7.39.0, curl attempts to automatically extract the
        public key from the private key file, so passing this option is
        generally not required. Note that this public key extraction requires
        libcurl to be linked against a copy of libssh2 1.2.8 or higher that is
        itself linked against OpenSSL.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-Q, --quote</dt>
  <dd>(FTP SFTP) Send an arbitrary command to the remote FTP or SFTP server.
      Quote commands are sent BEFORE the transfer takes place (just after the
      initial PWD command in an FTP transfer, to be exact). To make commands
      take place after a successful transfer, prefix them with a dash '-'. To
      make commands be sent after curl has changed the working directory, just
      before the transfer command(s), prefix the command with a '+' (this is
      only supported for FTP). You may specify any number of commands.
    <p class="Pp">If the server returns failure for one of the commands, the
        entire operation will be aborted. You must send syntactically correct
        FTP commands as RFC 959 defines to FTP servers, or one of the commands
        listed below to SFTP servers.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This option can be used multiple times. When speaking to an
        FTP server, prefix the command with an asterisk (*) to make curl
        continue even if the command fails as by default curl will stop at first
        failure.</p>
    <p class="Pp">SFTP is a binary protocol. Unlike for FTP, curl interprets
        SFTP quote commands itself before sending them to the server. File names
        may be quoted shell-style to embed spaces or special characters.
        Following is the list of all supported SFTP quote commands:</p>

        already exists in the current working directory it will not be
        overwritten and an error will occur. If the server doesn't specify a
        file name then this option has no effect.</p>
    <p class="Pp">There's no attempt to decode %-sequences (yet) in the provided
        file name, so this option may provide you with rather unexpected file
        names.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>WARNING</b>: Exercise judicious use of this option,
        especially on Windows. A rogue server could send you the name of a DLL
        or other file that could possibly be loaded automatically by Windows or
        some third party software.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--remote-name-all</dt>
  <dd>This option changes the default action for all given URLs to be dealt with
      as if <i>-O, --remote-name</i> were used for each one. So if you want to
      disable that for a specific URL after <i>--remote-name-all</i> has been
      used, you must use &quot;-o -&quot; or --no-remote-name.
    <p class="Pp">Added in 7.19.0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-O, --remote-name</dt>
  <dd>Write output to a local file named like the remote file we get. (Only the
      file part of the remote file is used, the path is cut off.)
    <p class="Pp">The file will be saved in the current working directory. If
        you want the file saved in a different directory, make sure you change
        the current working directory before invoking curl with this option.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The remote file name to use for saving is extracted from the
        given URL, nothing else, and if it already exists it will be
        overwritten. If you want the server to be able to choose the file name
        refer to <i>-J, --remote-header-name</i> which can be used in addition
        to this option. If the server chooses a file name and that name already
        exists it will not be overwritten.</p>
    <p class="Pp">There is no URL decoding done on the file name. If it has %20
        or other URL encoded parts of the name, they will end up as-is as file
        name.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs
        you have.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-R, --remote-time</dt>
  <dd>When used, this will make curl attempt to figure out the timestamp of the
      remote file, and if that is available make the local file get that same
      timestamp.</dd>
  <dt>--request-target</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Tells curl to use an alternative &quot;target&quot; (path) instead
      of using the path as provided in the URL. Particularly useful when wanting
      to issue HTTP requests without leading slash or other data that doesn't
      follow the regular URL pattern, like &quot;OPTIONS *&quot;.
    <p class="Pp">Added in 7.55.0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-X, --request &lt;command&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Specifies a custom request method to use when communicating with
      the HTTP server. The specified request method will be used instead of the
      method otherwise used (which defaults to GET). Read the HTTP 1.1
      specification for details and explanations. Common additional HTTP
      requests include PUT and DELETE, but related technologies like WebDAV
      offers PROPFIND, COPY, MOVE and more.
    <p class="Pp">Normally you don't need this option. All sorts of GET, HEAD,
        POST and PUT requests are rather invoked by using dedicated command line
        options.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This option only changes the actual word used in the HTTP
        request, it does not alter the way curl behaves. So for example if you
        want to make a proper HEAD request, using -X HEAD will not suffice. You
        need to use the <i>-I, --head</i> option.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The method string you set with <i>-X, --request</i> will be
        used for all requests, which if you for example use <i>-L,
        --location</i> may cause unintended side-effects when curl doesn't
        change request method according to the HTTP 30x response codes - and
        similar.</p>
    <p class="Pp">(FTP) Specifies a custom FTP command to use instead of LIST
        when doing file lists with FTP.</p>
    <p class="Pp">(POP3) Specifies a custom POP3 command to use instead of LIST
        or RETR. (Added in 7.26.0)</p>
    <p class="Pp">(IMAP) Specifies a custom IMAP command to use instead of LIST.
        (Added in 7.30.0)</p>
    <p class="Pp">(SMTP) Specifies a custom SMTP command to use instead of HELP
        or VRFY. (Added in 7.34.0)</p>
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used several times, the last one will be
        used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--resolve &lt;host:port:address[,address]...&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Provide a custom address for a specific host and port pair. Using this,
      you can make the curl requests(s) use a specified address and prevent the
      otherwise normally resolved address to be used. Consider it a sort of
      /etc/hosts alternative provided on the command line. The port number
      should be the number used for the specific protocol the host will be used
      for. It means you need several entries if you want to provide address for
      the same host but different ports.
    <p class="Pp">By specifying '*' as host you can tell curl to resolve any
        host and specific port pair to the specified address. Wildcard is
        resolved last so any <i>--resolve</i> with a specific host and port will
        be used first.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The provided address set by this option will be used even if
        <i>-4, --ipv4</i> or <i>-6, --ipv6</i> is set to make curl use another
        IP version.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Support for providing the IP address within [brackets] was
        added in 7.57.0.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Support for providing multiple IP addresses per entry was
        added in 7.59.0.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Support for resolving with wildcard was added in 7.64.0.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This option can be used many times to add many host names to
        resolve.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Added in 7.21.3.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--retry-connrefused</dt>
  <dd>In addition to the other conditions, consider ECONNREFUSED as a transient
      error too for <i>--retry</i>. This option is used together with --retry.
    <p class="Pp">Added in 7.52.0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--retry-delay &lt;seconds&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Make curl sleep this amount of time before each retry when a transfer has
      failed with a transient error (it changes the default backoff time
      algorithm between retries). This option is only interesting if
      <i>--retry</i> is also used. Setting this delay to zero will make curl use
      the default backoff time.
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used several times, the last one will be
        used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Added in 7.12.3.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--retry-max-time &lt;seconds&gt;</dt>
  <dd>The retry timer is reset before the first transfer attempt. Retries will
      be done as usual (see <i>--retry</i>) as long as the timer hasn't reached
      this given limit. Notice that if the timer hasn't reached the limit, the
      request will be made and while performing, it may take longer than this
      given time period. To limit a single request&#x00B4;s maximum time, use
      <i>-m, --max-time</i>. Set this option to zero to not timeout retries.
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used several times, the last one will be
        used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Added in 7.12.3.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--retry &lt;num&gt;</dt>
  <dd>If a transient error is returned when curl tries to perform a transfer, it
      will retry this number of times before giving up. Setting the number to 0
      makes curl do no retries (which is the default). Transient error means
      either: a timeout, an FTP 4xx response code or an HTTP 408 or 5xx response
      code.
    <p class="Pp">When curl is about to retry a transfer, it will first wait one
        second and then for all forthcoming retries it will double the waiting
        time until it reaches 10 minutes which then will be the delay between
        the rest of the retries. By using <i>--retry-delay</i> you disable this
        exponential backoff algorithm. See also <i>--retry-max-time</i> to limit
        the total time allowed for retries.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used several times, the last one will be
        used.</p>

    <p class="Pp">Added in 7.40.0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-T, --upload-file &lt;file&gt;</dt>
  <dd>This transfers the specified local file to the remote URL. If there is no
      file part in the specified URL, curl will append the local file name. NOTE
      that you must use a trailing / on the last directory to really prove to
      Curl that there is no file name or curl will think that your last
      directory name is the remote file name to use. That will most likely cause
      the upload operation to fail. If this is used on an HTTP(S) server, the
      PUT command will be used.
    <p class="Pp">Use the file name &quot;-&quot; (a single dash) to use stdin
        instead of a given file. Alternately, the file name &quot;.&quot; (a
        single period) may be specified instead of &quot;-&quot; to use stdin in
        non-blocking mode to allow reading server output while stdin is being
        uploaded.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can specify one <i>-T, --upload-file</i> for each URL on
        the command line. Each <i>-T, --upload-file</i> + URL pair specifies
        what to upload and to where. curl also supports &quot;globbing&quot; of
        the <i>-T, --upload-file</i> argument, meaning that you can upload
        multiple files to a single URL by using the same URL globbing style
        supported in the URL, like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp">
       curl --upload-file &quot;{file1,file2}&quot; http://www.example.com</p>
    <p class="Pp">or even</p>
    <p class="Pp">
       curl -T &quot;img[1-1000].png&quot; ftp://ftp.example.com/upload/</p>
    <p class="Pp">When uploading to an SMTP server: the uploaded data is assumed
        to be RFC 5322 formatted. It has to feature the necessary set of headers
        and mail body formatted correctly by the user as curl will not transcode
        nor encode it further in any way.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>--url &lt;url&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Specify a URL to fetch. This option is mostly handy when you want to
      specify URL(s) in a config file.
    <p class="Pp">If the given URL is missing a scheme name (such as
        &quot;http://&quot; or &quot;ftp://&quot; etc) then curl will make a
        guess based on the host. If the outermost sub-domain name matches DICT,
        FTP, IMAP, LDAP, POP3 or SMTP then that protocol will be used, otherwise
        HTTP will be used. Since 7.45.0 guessing can be disabled by setting a
        default protocol, see <i>--proto-default</i> for details.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This option may be used any number of times. To control where
        this URL is written, use the <i>-o, --output</i> or the <i>-O,
        --remote-name</i> options.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-B, --use-ascii</dt>
  <dd>(FTP LDAP) Enable ASCII transfer. For FTP, this can also be enforced by
      using a URL that ends with &quot;;type=A&quot;. This option causes data
      sent to stdout to be in text mode for win32 systems.</dd>
  <dt>-A, --user-agent &lt;name&gt;</dt>
  <dd>(HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP server. To encode
      blanks in the string, surround the string with single quote marks. This
      header can also be set with the <i>-H, --header</i> or the
      <i>--proxy-header</i> options.
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used several times, the last one will be
        used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-u, --user &lt;user:password&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Specify the user name and password to use for server authentication.
      Overrides <i>-n, --netrc</i> and <i>--netrc-optional</i>.
    <p class="Pp">If you simply specify the user name, curl will prompt for a
        password.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The user name and passwords are split up on the first colon,
        which makes it impossible to use a colon in the user name with this
        option. The password can, still.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On systems where it works, curl will hide the given option
        argument from process listings. This is not enough to protect
        credentials from possibly getting seen by other users on the same system
        as they will still be visible for a brief moment before cleared. Such
        sensitive data should be retrieved from a file instead or similar and
        never used in clear text in a command line.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When using Kerberos V5 with a Windows based server you should
        include the Windows domain name in the user name, in order for the
        server to successfully obtain a Kerberos Ticket. If you don't then the
        initial authentication handshake may fail.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When using NTLM, the user name can be specified simply as the
        user name, without the domain, if there is a single domain and forest in
        your setup for example.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To specify the domain name use either Down-Level Logon Name or
        UPN (User Principal Name) formats. For example, EXAMPLE\user and
        user@example.com respectively.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and perform
        Kerberos V5, Negotiate, NTLM or Digest authentication then you can tell
        curl to select the user name and password from your environment by
        specifying a single colon with this option: &quot;-u :&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If this option is used several times, the last one will be
        used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-v, --verbose</dt>
  <dd>Makes curl verbose during the operation. Useful for debugging and seeing
      what's going on &quot;under the hood&quot;. A line starting with '&gt;'
      means &quot;header data&quot; sent by curl, '&lt;' means &quot;header
      data&quot; received by curl that is hidden in normal cases, and a line
      starting with '*' means additional info provided by curl.
    <p class="Pp">If you only want HTTP headers in the output, <i>-i,
        --include</i> might be the option you're looking for.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you think this option still doesn't give you enough
        details, consider using <i>--trace</i> or <i>--trace-ascii</i>
      instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Use <i>-s, --silent</i> to make curl really quiet.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See also <i>-i, --include</i>. This option overrides
        <i>--trace</i> and <i>--trace-ascii</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-V, --version</dt>
  <dd>Displays information about curl and the libcurl version it uses.
    <p class="Pp">The first line includes the full version of curl, libcurl and
        other 3rd party libraries linked with the executable.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The second line (starts with &quot;Protocols:&quot;) shows all

  PROTOCOL PREFIXES</a></h1>
Since curl version 7.21.7, the proxy string may be specified with a protocol://
  prefix to specify alternative proxy protocols.
<p class="Pp">If no protocol is specified in the proxy string or if the string
    doesn't match a supported one, the proxy will be treated as an HTTP
  proxy.</p>
<p class="Pp">The supported proxy protocol prefixes are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>http://</dt>
  <dd>Makes it use it as an HTTP proxy. The default if no scheme prefix is
    used.</dd>
  <dt>https://</dt>
  <dd>Makes it treated as an <b>HTTPS</b> proxy.</dd>
  <dt>socks4://</dt>
  <dd>Makes it the equivalent of <i>--socks4</i></dd>
  <dt>socks4a://</dt>
  <dd>Makes it the equivalent of <i>--socks4a</i></dd>
  <dt>socks5://</dt>
  <dd>Makes it the equivalent of <i>--socks5</i></dd>
  <dt>socks5h://</dt>
  <dd>Makes it the equivalent of <i>--socks5-hostname</i></dd>

  CODES</a></h1>
There are a bunch of different error codes and their corresponding error
  messages that may appear during bad conditions. At the time of this writing,
  the exit codes are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1</dt>
  <dd>Unsupported protocol. This build of curl has no support for this
    protocol.</dd>
  <dt>2</dt>
  <dd>Failed to initialize.</dd>
  <dt>3</dt>
  <dd>URL malformed. The syntax was not correct.</dd>
  <dt>4</dt>
  <dd>A feature or option that was needed to perform the desired request was not
      enabled or was explicitly disabled at build-time. To make curl able to do
      this, you probably need another build of libcurl!</dd>
  <dt>5</dt>
  <dd>Couldn't resolve proxy. The given proxy host could not be resolved.</dd>
  <dt>6</dt>
  <dd>Couldn't resolve host. The given remote host was not resolved.</dd>
  <dt>7</dt>
  <dd>Failed to connect to host.</dd>
  <dt>8</dt>
  <dd>Weird server reply. The server sent data curl couldn't parse.</dd>
  <dt>9</dt>
  <dd>FTP access denied. The server denied login or denied access to the
      particular resource or directory you wanted to reach. Most often you tried
      to change to a directory that doesn't exist on the server.</dd>
  <dt>10</dt>
  <dd>FTP accept failed. While waiting for the server to connect back when an
      active FTP session is used, an error code was sent over the control
      connection or similar.</dd>
  <dt>11</dt>
  <dd>FTP weird PASS reply. Curl couldn't parse the reply sent to the PASS
      request.</dd>
  <dt>12</dt>
  <dd>During an active FTP session while waiting for the server to connect back
      to curl, the timeout expired.</dd>
  <dt>13</dt>
  <dd>FTP weird PASV reply, Curl couldn't parse the reply sent to the PASV
      request.</dd>

  <dd>FTP weird 227 format. Curl couldn't parse the 227-line the server
    sent.</dd>

  <dd>FTP can't get host. Couldn't resolve the host IP we got in the
    227-line.</dd>
  <dt>16</dt>
  <dd>HTTP/2 error. A problem was detected in the HTTP2 framing layer. This is
      somewhat generic and can be one out of several problems, see the error
      message for details.</dd>
  <dt>17</dt>
  <dd>FTP couldn't set binary. Couldn't change transfer method to binary.</dd>
  <dt>18</dt>

      code only appears if <i>-f, --fail</i> is used.</dd>
  <dt>23</dt>
  <dd>Write error. Curl couldn't write data to a local filesystem or
    similar.</dd>

      PORT command, try doing a transfer using PASV instead!</dd>
  <dt>31</dt>
  <dd>FTP couldn't use REST. The REST command failed. This command is used for
      resumed FTP transfers.</dd>
  <dt>33</dt>
