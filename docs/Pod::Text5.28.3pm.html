Pod::Text is a module that can convert documentation in the POD format (the
  preferred language for documenting Perl) into formatted text. It uses no
  special formatting controls or codes whatsoever, and its output is therefore
  suitable for nearly any device.
<p class="Pp">As a derived class from Pod::Simple, Pod::Text supports the same
    methods and interfaces. See Pod::Simple for all the details; briefly, one
    creates a new parser with
    <span class="Li">&quot;Pod::Text-&gt;new()&quot;</span> and then normally
    calls <b>parse_file()</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>new()</b> can take options, in the form of key/value pairs,
    that control the behavior of the parser. The currently recognized options
    are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>alt</dt>
  <dd>If set to a true value, selects an alternate output format that, among
      other things, uses a different heading style and marks
      <span class="Li">&quot;=item&quot;</span> entries with a colon in the left
      margin. Defaults to false.</dd>
  <dt>code</dt>
  <dd>If set to a true value, the non-POD parts of the input file will be
      included in the output. Useful for viewing code documented with POD blocks
      with the POD rendered and the code left intact.</dd>
  <dt>errors</dt>
  <dd>How to report errors. <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span> says to
      throw an exception on any POD formatting error.
      <span class="Li">&quot;stderr&quot;</span> says to report errors on
      standard error, but not to throw an exception.
      <span class="Li">&quot;pod&quot;</span> says to include a POD ERRORS
      section in the resulting documentation summarizing the errors.
      <span class="Li">&quot;none&quot;</span> ignores POD errors entirely, as
      much as possible.
    <p class="Pp">The default is <span class="Li">&quot;pod&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>indent</dt>
  <dd>The number of spaces to indent regular text, and the default indentation
      for <span class="Li">&quot;=over&quot;</span> blocks. Defaults to 4.</dd>
  <dt>loose</dt>
  <dd>If set to a true value, a blank line is printed after a
      <span class="Li">&quot;=head1&quot;</span> heading. If set to false (the
      default), no blank line is printed after
      <span class="Li">&quot;=head1&quot;</span>, although one is still printed
      after <span class="Li">&quot;=head2&quot;</span>. This is the default
      because it's the expected formatting for manual pages; if you're
      formatting arbitrary text documents, setting this to true may result in
      more pleasing output.</dd>
  <dt>margin</dt>
  <dd>The width of the left margin in spaces. Defaults to 0. This is the margin
      for all text, including headings, not the amount by which regular text is
      indented; for the latter, see the <i>indent</i> option. To set the right
      margin, see the <i>width</i> option.</dd>
  <dt>nourls</dt>
  <dd>Normally, L&lt;&gt; formatting codes with a URL but anchor text are
      formatted to show both the anchor text and the URL. In other words:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    L&lt;foo|http://example.com/&gt;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is formatted as:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    foo &lt;http://example.com/&gt;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This option, if set to a true value, suppresses the URL when
        anchor text is given, so this example would be formatted as just
        <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span>. This can produce less cluttered
        output in cases where the URLs are not particularly important.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>quotes</dt>
  <dd>Sets the quote marks used to surround C&lt;&gt; text. If the value is a
      single character, it is used as both the left and right quote. Otherwise,
      it is split in half, and the first half of the string is used as the left
      quote and the second is used as the right quote.
    <p class="Pp">This may also be set to the special value
        <span class="Li">&quot;none&quot;</span>, in which case no quote marks
        are added around C&lt;&gt; text.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>sentence</dt>
  <dd>If set to a true value, Pod::Text will assume that each sentence ends in
      two spaces, and will try to preserve that spacing. If set to false, all
      consecutive whitespace in non-verbatim paragraphs is compressed into a
      single space. Defaults to true.</dd>
  <dt>stderr</dt>
  <dd>Send error messages about invalid POD to standard error instead of
      appending a POD ERRORS section to the generated output. This is equivalent
      to setting <span class="Li">&quot;errors&quot;</span> to
      <span class="Li">&quot;stderr&quot;</span> if
      <span class="Li">&quot;errors&quot;</span> is not already set. It is
      supported for backward compatibility.</dd>
  <dt>utf8</dt>
  <dd>By default, Pod::Text uses the same output encoding as the input encoding
      of the POD source (provided that Perl was built with PerlIO; otherwise, it
      doesn't encode its output). If this option is given, the output encoding
      is forced to UTF-8.
    <p class="Pp">Be aware that, when using this option, the input encoding of
        your POD source should be properly declared unless it's US-ASCII.
        Pod::Simple will attempt to guess the encoding and may be successful if
        it's Latin-1 or UTF-8, but it will produce warnings. Use the
        <span class="Li">&quot;=encoding&quot;</span> command to declare the
        encoding. See <b>perlpod</b>(1) for more information.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>width</dt>
  <dd>The column at which to wrap text on the right-hand side. Defaults to
    76.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The standard Pod::Simple method <b>parse_file()</b> takes one
    argument naming the POD file to read from. By default, the output is sent to
    <span class="Li">&quot;STDOUT&quot;</span>, but this can be changed with the
    <b>output_fh()</b> method.</p>
<p class="Pp">The standard Pod::Simple method <b>parse_from_file()</b> takes up
    to two arguments, the first being the input file to read POD from and the
    second being the file to write the formatted output to.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also call <b>parse_lines()</b> to parse an array of lines
    or <b>parse_string_document()</b> to parse a document already in memory. As
    with <b>parse_file()</b>, <b>parse_lines()</b> and
    <b>parse_string_document()</b> default to sending their output to
    <span class="Li">&quot;STDOUT&quot;</span> unless changed with the
    <b>output_fh()</b> method.</p>
<p class="Pp">To put the output from any parse method into a string instead of a
    file handle, call the <b>output_string()</b> method instead of
    <b>output_fh()</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">See Pod::Simple for more specific details on the methods available
    to all derived parsers.</p>

Encoding handling assumes that PerlIO is available and does not work properly if
  it isn't. The <span class="Li">&quot;utf8&quot;</span> option is therefore not
  supported unless Perl is built with PerlIO support.

<h1 class="Sh" id="CAVEATS"><a class="permalink" href="#CAVEATS">CAVEATS</a></h1>
If Pod::Text is given the <span class="Li">&quot;utf8&quot;</span> option, the
  encoding of its output file handle will be forced to UTF-8 if possible,
  overriding any existing encoding. This will be done even if the file handle is
  not created by Pod::Text and was passed in from outside. This maintains
  consistency regardless of PERL_UNICODE and other settings.
<p class="Pp">If the <span class="Li">&quot;utf8&quot;</span> option is not
    given, the encoding of its output file handle will be forced to the detected
    encoding of the input POD, which preserves whatever the input text is. This
    ensures backward compatibility with earlier, pre-Unicode versions of this
    module, without large numbers of Perl warnings.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is not ideal, but it seems to be the best compromise. If it
    doesn't work for you, please let me know the details of how it broke.</p>

This is a replacement for an earlier Pod::Text module written by Tom
  Christiansen. It has a revamped interface, since it now uses Pod::Simple, but
  an interface roughly compatible with the old <b>Pod::Text::pod2text()</b>
  function is still available. Please change to the new calling convention,
  though.
<p class="Pp">The original Pod::Text contained code to do formatting via termcap
    sequences, although it wasn't turned on by default and it was problematic to
    get it to work at all. This rewrite doesn't even try to do that, but a
    subclass of it does. Look for Pod::Text::Termcap.</p>

Russ Allbery &lt;rra@cpan.org&gt;, based <i>very</i> heavily on the original
  Pod::Text by Tom Christiansen &lt;tchrist@mox.perl.com&gt; and its conversion
  to Pod::Parser by Brad Appleton &lt;bradapp@enteract.com&gt;. Sean Burke's
  initial conversion of Pod::Man to use Pod::Simple provided much-needed
  guidance on how to use Pod::Simple.
