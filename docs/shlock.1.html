The <code class="Nm">shlock</code> command can create or verify a lock file on
  behalf of a shell or other script program. When it attempts to create a lock
  file, if one already exists, <code class="Nm">shlock</code> verifies that it
  is or is not valid. If valid, <code class="Nm">shlock</code> will exit with a
  non-zero exit code. If invalid, <code class="Nm">shlock</code> will remove the
  lock file, and create a new one.
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">shlock</code> uses the <a class="Xr">link(2)</a>
    system call to make the final target lock file, which is an atomic operation
    (i.e. &quot;dot locking&quot;, so named for this mechanism's original use
    for locking system mailboxes). It puts the process ID (&quot;PID&quot;) from
    the command line into the requested lock file.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">shlock</code> verifies that an extant lock file
    is still valid by using <a class="Xr">kill(2)</a> with a zero signal to
    check for the existence of the process that holds the lock.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Fl">-d</code> option causes
    <code class="Nm">shlock</code> to be verbose about what it is doing.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Fl">-f</code> argument with
    <var class="Ar">lockfile</var> is always required.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Fl">-p</code> option with
    <var class="Ar">PID</var> is given when the program is to create a lock
    file; when absent, <code class="Nm">shlock</code> will simply check for the
    validity of the lock file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Fl">-u</code> option causes
    <code class="Nm">shlock</code> to read and write the PID as a binary pid_t,
    instead of as ASCII, to be compatible with the locks created by UUCP.</p>

<code class="Nm">shlock</code> was written for the first Network News Transfer
  Protocol (NNTP) software distribution, released in March 1986. The algorithm
  was suggested by Peter Honeyman, from work he did on HoneyDanBer UUCP.

Does not work on NFS or other network file system on different systems because
  the disparate systems have disjoint PID spaces.
<p class="Pp">Cannot handle the case where a lock file was not deleted, the
    process that created it has exited, and the system has created a new process
    with the same PID as in the dead lock file. The lock file will appear to be
    valid even though the process is unrelated to the one that created the lock
    in the first place. Always remove your lock files after you're done.</p>
