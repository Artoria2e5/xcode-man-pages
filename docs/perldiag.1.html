   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of
  desperation):
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    (W) A warning (optional).
    (D) A deprecation (enabled by default).
    (S) A severe warning (enabled by default).
    (F) A fatal error (trappable).
    (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).
    (X) A very fatal error (nontrappable).
    (A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The majority of messages from the first three classifications
    above (W, D &amp; S) can be controlled using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a message can be controlled by the
    <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma, its warning category is
    included with the classification letter in the description below. E.g.
    <span class="Li">&quot;(W closed)&quot;</span> means a warning in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;closed&quot;</span> category.</p>
<p class="Pp">Optional warnings are enabled by using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma or the <b>-w</b> and
    <b>-W</b> switches. Warnings may be captured by setting
    <span class="Li">$SIG{__WARN__}</span> to a reference to a routine that will
    be called on each warning instead of printing it. See perlvar.</p>
<p class="Pp">Severe warnings are always enabled, unless they are explicitly
    disabled with the <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma or the
    <b>-X</b> switch.</p>
<p class="Pp">Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator. See
    &quot;eval&quot; in perlfunc. In almost all cases, warnings may be
    selectively disabled or promoted to fatal errors using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma. See warnings.</p>
<p class="Pp">The messages are in alphabetical order, without regard to upper or
    lower-case. Some of these messages are generic. Spots that vary are denoted
    with a <span class="Li">%s</span> or other printf-style escape. These
    escapes are ignored by the alphabetical order, as are all characters other
    than letters. To look up your message, just ignore anything that is not a
    letter.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>accept()</i> on closed socket %s</dt>
  <dd>(W closed) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket. Did you forget to
      check the return value of your <i>socket()</i> call? See
      &quot;accept&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Allocation too large: %x</dt>
  <dd>(X) You can't allocate more than 64K on an MS-DOS machine.</dd>
  <dt>'%c' allowed only after types %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The modifiers '!', '&lt;' and '&gt;' are allowed in <i>pack()</i> or
      <i>unpack()</i> only after certain types. See &quot;pack&quot; in
      perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;</dt>
  <dd>(W ambiguous) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl
      keyword, and you have used the name without qualification for calling one
      or the other. Perl decided to call the builtin because the subroutine is
      not imported.
    <p class="Pp">To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an
        ampersand before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its
        package. Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend that
        it's imported with the <span class="Li">&quot;use subs&quot;</span>
        pragma).</p>
    <p class="Pp">To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the
        <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::&quot;</span> prefix on the operator (e.g.
        <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::log($x)&quot;</span>) or declare the
        subroutine to be an object method (see &quot;Subroutine Attributes&quot;
        in perlsub or attributes).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Ambiguous range in transliteration operator</dt>
  <dd>(F) You wrote something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;tr/a-z-0//&quot;</span> which doesn't mean anything
      at all. To include a <span class="Li">&quot;-&quot;</span> character in a
      transliteration, put it either first or last. (In the past,
      <span class="Li">&quot;tr/a-z-0//&quot;</span> was synonymous with
      <span class="Li">&quot;tr/a-y//&quot;</span>, which was probably not what
      you would have expected.)</dd>
  <dt>Ambiguous use of %s resolved as %s</dt>
  <dd>(S ambiguous) You said something that may not be interpreted the way you
      thought. Normally it's pretty easy to disambiguate it by supplying a
      missing quote, operator, parenthesis pair or declaration.</dd>
  <dt>Ambiguous use of %c resolved as operator %c</dt>
  <dd>(S ambiguous) <span class="Li">&quot;%&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> are both infix operators (modulus,
      bitwise and, and multiplication) <i>and</i> initial special characters
      (denoting hashes, subroutines and typeglobs), and you said something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;*foo * foo&quot;</span> that might be interpreted
      as either of them. We assumed you meant the infix operator, but please try
      to make it more clear -- in the example given, you might write
      <span class="Li">&quot;*foo * foo()&quot;</span> if you really meant to
      multiply a glob by the result of calling a function.</dd>
  <dt>Ambiguous use of %c{%s} resolved to %c%s</dt>
  <dd>(W ambiguous) You wrote something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;@{foo}&quot;</span>, which might be asking for the
      variable <span class="Li">@foo</span>, or it might be calling a function
      named foo, and dereferencing it as an array reference. If you wanted the
      variable, you can just write <span class="Li">@foo</span>. If you wanted
      to call the function, write <span class="Li">&quot;@{foo()}&quot;</span>
      ... or you could just not have a variable and a function with the same
      name, and save yourself a lot of trouble.</dd>
  <dt>Ambiguous use of %c{%s[...]} resolved to %c%s[...]</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>Ambiguous use of %c{%s{...}} resolved to %c%s{...}</dt>
  <dd>(W ambiguous) You wrote something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;${foo[2]}&quot;</span> (where foo represents the
      name of a Perl keyword), which might be looking for element number 2 of
      the array named <span class="Li">@foo</span>, in which case please write
      <span class="Li">$foo[2]</span>, or you might have meant to pass an
      anonymous arrayref to the function named foo, and then do a scalar deref
      on the value it returns. If you meant that, write
      <span class="Li">&quot;${foo([2])}&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">In regular expressions, the
        <span class="Li">&quot;${foo[2]}&quot;</span> syntax is sometimes
        necessary to disambiguate between array subscripts and character
        classes. <span class="Li">&quot;/$length[2345]/&quot;</span>, for
        instance, will be interpreted as <span class="Li">$length</span>
        followed by the character class
        <span class="Li">&quot;[2345]&quot;</span>. If an array subscript is
        what you want, you can avoid the warning by changing
        <span class="Li">&quot;/${length[2345]}/&quot;</span> to the unsightly
        <span class="Li">&quot;/${\$length[2345]}/&quot;</span>, by renaming
        your array to something that does not coincide with a built-in keyword,
        or by simply turning off warnings with <span class="Li">&quot;no
        warnings 'ambiguous';&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Ambiguous use of -%s resolved as -&amp;%s()</dt>
  <dd>(S ambiguous) You wrote something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;-foo&quot;</span>, which might be the string
      <span class="Li">&quot;-foo&quot;</span>, or a call to the function
      <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span>, negated. If you meant the string,
      just write <span class="Li">&quot;-foo&quot;</span>. If you meant the
      function call, write <span class="Li">&quot;-foo()&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>'|' and '&lt;' may not both be specified on command line</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line redirection,
      and found that STDIN was a pipe, and that you also tried to redirect STDIN
      using '&lt;'. Only one STDIN stream to a customer, please.</dd>
  <dt>'|' and '&gt;' may not both be specified on command line</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line redirection,
      and thinks you tried to redirect stdout both to a file and into a pipe to
      another command. You need to choose one or the other, though nothing's
      stopping you from piping into a program or Perl script which 'splits'
      output into two streams, such as
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    open(OUT,&quot;&gt;$ARGV[0]&quot;) or die &quot;Can't write to $ARGV[0]: $!&quot;;
    while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
        print;
        print OUT;
    }
    close OUT;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Applying %s to %s will act on scalar(%s)</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) The pattern match (<span class="Li">&quot;//&quot;</span>),
      substitution (<span class="Li">&quot;s///&quot;</span>), and
      transliteration (<span class="Li">&quot;tr///&quot;</span>) operators work
      on scalar values. If you apply one of them to an array or a hash, it will
      convert the array or hash to a scalar value (the length of an array, or
      the population info of a hash) and then work on that scalar value. This is
      probably not what you meant to do. See &quot;grep&quot; in perlfunc and
      &quot;map&quot; in perlfunc for alternatives.</dd>
  <dt>Arg too short for msgsnd</dt>
  <dd>(F) <i>msgsnd()</i> requires a string at least as long as
    sizeof(long).</dd>
  <dt>%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element or a subroutine</dt>
  <dd>(F) The argument to <i>exists()</i> must be a hash or array element or a
      subroutine with an ampersand, such as:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $foo{$bar}
    $ref-&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12]
    &amp;do_something
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>%s argument is not a HASH or ARRAY element or slice</dt>
  <dd>(F) The argument to <i>delete()</i> must be either a hash or array
      element, such as:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $foo{$bar}
    $ref-&gt;{&quot;susie&quot;}[12]
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or a hash or array slice, such as:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    @foo[$bar, $baz, $xyzzy]
    @{$ref-&gt;[12]}{&quot;susie&quot;, &quot;queue&quot;}
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>%s argument is not a subroutine name</dt>
  <dd>(F) The argument to <i>exists()</i> for <span class="Li">&quot;exists
      &amp;sub&quot;</span> must be a subroutine name, and not a subroutine
      call. <span class="Li">&quot;exists &amp;sub()&quot;</span> will generate
      this error.</dd>
  <dt>Argument &quot;%s&quot; isn't numeric%s</dt>
  <dd>(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator
      that expected a numeric value instead. If you're fortunate the message
      will identify which operator was so unfortunate.</dd>
  <dt>Argument list not closed for PerlIO layer &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(W layer) When pushing a layer with arguments onto the Perl I/O system you
      forgot the ) that closes the argument list. (Layers take care of
      transforming data between external and internal representations.) Perl
      stopped parsing the layer list at this point and did not attempt to push
      this layer. If your program didn't explicitly request the failing
      operation, it may be the result of the value of the environment variable
      PERLIO.</dd>
  <dt>Array @%s missing the @ in argument %d of %s()</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the @ on array names in some
      spots. This is now heavily deprecated.</dd>
  <dt>A sequence of multiple spaces in a charnames alias definition is
    deprecated</dt>
  <dd>(D) You defined a character name which had multiple space characters in a
      row. Change them to single spaces. Usually these names are defined in the
      <span class="Li">&quot;:alias&quot;</span> import argument to
      <span class="Li">&quot;use charnames&quot;</span>, but they could be
      defined by a translator installed into
      <span class="Li">$^H{charnames}</span>. See &quot;CUSTOM ALIASES&quot; in
      charnames.</dd>
  <dt>assertion botched: %s</dt>
  <dd>(X) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.</dd>
  <dt>Assertion failed: file &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(X) A general assertion failed. The file in question must be
    examined.</dd>
  <dt>Assigning non-zero to $[ is no longer possible</dt>
  <dd>(F) When the &quot;array_base&quot; feature is disabled (e.g., under
      <span class="Li">&quot;use v5.16;&quot;</span>) the special variable
      <span class="Li">$[</span>, which is deprecated, is now a fixed zero
      value.</dd>
  <dt>Assignment to both a list and a scalar</dt>
  <dd>(F) If you assign to a conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd arguments
      must either both be scalars or both be lists. Otherwise Perl won't know
      which context to supply to the right side.</dd>
  <dt>A thread exited while %d threads were running</dt>
  <dd>(W threads)(S) When using threaded Perl, a thread (not necessarily the
      main thread) exited while there were still other threads running. Usually
      it's a good idea first to collect the return values of the created threads
      by joining them, and only then to exit from the main thread. See
    threads.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to access disallowed key '%s' in a restricted hash</dt>
  <dd>(F) The failing code has attempted to get or set a key which is not in the
      current set of allowed keys of a restricted hash.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to bless into a reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) The CLASSNAME argument to the <i>bless()</i> operator is expected to
      be the name of the package to bless the resulting object into. You've
      supplied instead a reference to something: perhaps you wrote
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    bless $self, $proto;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">when you intended</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    bless $self, ref($proto) || $proto;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you actually want to bless into the stringified version of
        the reference supplied, you need to stringify it yourself, for example
        by:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    bless $self, &quot;$proto&quot;;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Attempt to clear deleted array</dt>
  <dd>(S debugging) An array was assigned to when it was being freed. Freed
      values are not supposed to be visible to Perl code. This can also happen
      if XS code calls <span class="Li">&quot;av_clear&quot;</span> from a
      custom magic callback on the array.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to delete disallowed key '%s' from a restricted hash</dt>
  <dd>(F) The failing code attempted to delete from a restricted hash a key
      which is not in its key set.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to delete readonly key '%s' from a restricted hash</dt>
  <dd>(F) The failing code attempted to delete a key whose value has been
      declared readonly from a restricted hash.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to free non-arena SV: 0x%x</dt>
  <dd>(S internal) All SV objects are supposed to be allocated from arenas that
      will be garbage collected on exit. An SV was discovered to be outside any
      of those arenas.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to free nonexistent shared string '%s'%s</dt>
  <dd>(S internal) Perl maintains a reference-counted internal table of strings
      to optimize the storage and access of hash keys and other strings. This
      indicates someone tried to decrement the reference count of a string that
      can no longer be found in the table.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to free temp prematurely: SV 0x%x</dt>
  <dd>(S debugging) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the
      <i>free_tmps()</i> routine. This indicates that something else is freeing
      the SV before the <i>free_tmps()</i> routine gets a chance, which means
      that the <i>free_tmps()</i> routine will be freeing an unreferenced scalar
      when it does try to free it.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers</dt>
  <dd>(S internal) The reference counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0x%x</dt>
  <dd>(S internal) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to see
      if it would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0 earlier,
      and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed. This could
      indicate that <i>SvREFCNT_dec()</i> was called too many times, or that
      <i>SvREFCNT_inc()</i> was called too few times, or that the SV was
      mortalized when it shouldn't have been, or that memory has been
    corrupted.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to join self</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to join a thread from within itself, which is an impossible
      task. You may be joining the wrong thread, or you may need to move the
      <i>join()</i> to some other thread.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to pack pointer to temporary value</dt>
  <dd>(W pack) You tried to pass a temporary value (like the result of a
      function, or a computed expression) to the &quot;p&quot; <i>pack()</i>
      template. This means the result contains a pointer to a location that
      could become invalid anytime, even before the end of the current
      statement. Use literals or global values as arguments to the &quot;p&quot;
      <i>pack()</i> template to avoid this warning.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to reload %s aborted.</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to load a file with <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>
      or <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> that failed to compile once
      already. Perl will not try to compile this file again unless you delete
      its entry from <span class="Li">%INC</span>. See &quot;require&quot; in
      perlfunc and &quot;%INC&quot; in perlvar.</dd>
  <dt>Attempt to set length of freed array</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You tried to set the length of an array which has been freed. You
      can do this by storing a reference to the scalar representing the last
      index of an array and later assigning through that reference. For example
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $r = do {my @a; \$#a};
    $$r = 503
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Attempt to use reference as lvalue in substr</dt>
  <dd>(W substr) You supplied a reference as the first argument to
      <i>substr()</i> used as an lvalue, which is pretty strange. Perhaps you
      forgot to dereference it first. See &quot;substr&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Attribute &quot;locked&quot; is deprecated</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) You have used the attributes pragma to modify the
      &quot;locked&quot; attribute on a code reference. The :locked attribute is
      obsolete, has had no effect since 5005 threads were removed, and will be
      removed in a future release of Perl 5.</dd>
  <dt>Attribute &quot;unique&quot; is deprecated</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) You have used the attributes pragma to modify the
      &quot;unique&quot; attribute on an array, hash or scalar reference. The
      :unique attribute has had no effect since Perl 5.8.8, and will be removed
      in a future release of Perl 5.</dd>
  <dt>av_reify called on tied array</dt>
  <dd>(S debugging) This indicates that something went wrong and Perl got
      <i>very</i> confused about <span class="Li">@_</span> or
      <span class="Li">@DB::args</span> being tied.</dd>
  <dt>Bad arg length for %s, is %u, should be %d</dt>
  <dd>(F) You passed a buffer of the wrong size to one of <i>msgctl()</i>,
      <i>semctl()</i> or <i>shmctl()</i>. In C parlance, the correct sizes are,
      respectively, sizeof(struct&#x00A0;msqid_ds&#x00A0;*),
      sizeof(struct&#x00A0;semid_ds&#x00A0;*), and
      sizeof(struct&#x00A0;shmid_ds&#x00A0;*).</dd>
  <dt>Bad evalled substitution pattern</dt>
  <dd>(F) You've used the <span class="Li">&quot;/e&quot;</span> switch to
      evaluate the replacement for a substitution, but perl found a syntax error
      in the code to evaluate, most likely an unexpected right brace '}'.</dd>
  <dt>Bad filehandle: %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) A symbol was passed to something wanting a filehandle, but the symbol
      has no filehandle associated with it. Perhaps you didn't do an
      <i>open()</i>, or did it in another package.</dd>
  <dt>Bad <i>free()</i> ignored</dt>
  <dd>(S malloc) An internal routine called <i>free()</i> on something that had
      never been <i>malloc()</i>ed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be
      disabled by setting environment variable
      <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_BADFREE&quot;</span> to 0.
    <p class="Pp">This message can be seen quite often with DB_File on systems
        with &quot;hard&quot; dynamic linking, like
        <span class="Li">&quot;AIX&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;OS/2&quot;</span>. It is a bug of
        <span class="Li">&quot;Berkeley DB&quot;</span> which is left unnoticed
        if <span class="Li">&quot;DB&quot;</span> uses <i>forgiving</i> system
        <i>malloc()</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Bad hash</dt>
  <dd>(P) One of the internal hash routines was passed a null HV pointer.</dd>
  <dt>Badly placed ()'s</dt>
  <dd>(A) You've accidentally run your script through <b>csh</b> instead of
      Perl. Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
    yourself.</dd>
  <dt>Bad name after %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You started to name a symbol by using a package prefix, and then
      didn't finish the symbol. In particular, you can't interpolate outside of
      quotes, so
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $var = 'myvar';
    $sym = mypack::$var;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is not the same as</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $var = 'myvar';
    $sym = &quot;mypack::$var&quot;;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Bad plugin affecting keyword '%s'</dt>
  <dd>(F) An extension using the keyword plugin mechanism violated the plugin
      API.</dd>
  <dt>Bad <i>realloc()</i> ignored</dt>
  <dd>(S malloc) An internal routine called <i>realloc()</i> on something that
      had never been <i>malloc()</i>ed in the first place. Mandatory, but can be
      disabled by setting the environment variable
      <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_BADFREE&quot;</span> to 1.</dd>
  <dt>Bad symbol for array</dt>
  <dd>(P) An internal request asked to add an array entry to something that
      wasn't a symbol table entry.</dd>
  <dt>Bad symbol for dirhandle</dt>
  <dd>(P) An internal request asked to add a dirhandle entry to something that
      wasn't a symbol table entry.</dd>
  <dt>Bad symbol for filehandle</dt>
  <dd>(P) An internal request asked to add a filehandle entry to something that
      wasn't a symbol table entry.</dd>
  <dt>Bad symbol for hash</dt>
  <dd>(P) An internal request asked to add a hash entry to something that wasn't
      a symbol table entry.</dd>
  <dt>Bareword found in conditional</dt>
  <dd>(W bareword) The compiler found a bareword where it expected a
      conditional, which often indicates that an || or &amp;&amp; was parsed as
      part of the last argument of the previous construct, for example:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    open FOO || die;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">It may also indicate a misspelled constant that has been
        interpreted as a bareword:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    use constant TYPO =&gt; 1;
    if (TYOP) { print &quot;foo&quot; }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;strict&quot;</span> pragma is
        useful in avoiding such errors.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Bareword &quot;%s&quot; not allowed while &quot;strict subs&quot; in
    use</dt>
  <dd>(F) With &quot;strict subs&quot; in use, a bareword is only allowed as a
      subroutine identifier, in curly brackets or to the left of the
      &quot;=&gt;&quot; symbol. Perhaps you need to predeclare a
    subroutine?</dd>
  <dt>Bareword &quot;%s&quot; refers to nonexistent package</dt>
  <dd>(W bareword) You used a qualified bareword of the form
      <span class="Li">&quot;Foo::&quot;</span>, but the compiler saw no other
      uses of that namespace before that point. Perhaps you need to predeclare a
      package?</dd>
  <dt>BEGIN failed--compilation aborted</dt>
  <dd>(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a BEGIN subroutine.
      Compilation stops immediately and the interpreter is exited.</dd>
  <dt>BEGIN not safe after errors--compilation aborted</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl found a <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN {}&quot;</span> subroutine
      (or a <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> directive, which implies a
      <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN {}&quot;</span>) after one or more
      compilation errors had already occurred. Since the intended environment
      for the <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN {}&quot;</span> could not be
      guaranteed (due to the errors), and since subsequent code likely depends
      on its correct operation, Perl just gave up.</dd>
  <dt>\1 better written as $1</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) Outside of patterns, backreferences live on as variables. The
      use of backslashes is grandfathered on the right-hand side of a
      substitution, but stylistically it's better to use the variable form
      because other Perl programmers will expect it, and it works better if
      there are more than 9 backreferences.</dd>
  <dt>Binary number &gt; 0b11111111111111111111111111111111 non-portable</dt>
  <dd>(W portable) The binary number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
      (4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems. See perlport for
      more on portability concerns.</dd>
  <dt><i>bind()</i> on closed socket %s</dt>
  <dd>(W closed) You tried to do a bind on a closed socket. Did you forget to
      check the return value of your <i>socket()</i> call? See &quot;bind&quot;
      in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt><i>binmode()</i> on closed filehandle %s</dt>
  <dd>(W unopened) You tried <i>binmode()</i> on a filehandle that was never
      opened. Check your control flow and number of arguments.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;\b{&quot; is deprecated; use &quot;\b\{&quot; or &quot;\b[{]&quot;

  <dt>&quot;\B{&quot; is deprecated; use &quot;\B\{&quot; or &quot;\B[{]&quot;
    instead in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(W deprecated) Use of an unescaped &quot;{&quot; immediately following a
      <span class="Li">&quot;\b&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;\B&quot;</span> is now deprecated so as to reserve
      its use for Perl itself in a future release. You can either precede the
      brace with a backslash, or enclose it in square brackets; the latter is
      the way to go if the pattern delimiters are
      <span class="Li">&quot;{}&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Bit vector size &gt; 32 non-portable</dt>
  <dd>(W portable) Using bit vector sizes larger than 32 is non-portable.</dd>
  <dt>Bizarre copy of %s</dt>
  <dd>(P) Perl detected an attempt to copy an internal value that is not
      copiable.</dd>
  <dt>Buffer overflow in prime_env_iter: %s</dt>
  <dd>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS. While Perl was preparing to
      iterate over <span class="Li">%ENV</span>, it encountered a logical name
      or symbol definition which was too long, so it was truncated to the string
      shown.</dd>
  <dt>Bizarre SvTYPE [%d]</dt>
  <dd>(P) When starting a new thread or return values from a thread, Perl
      encountered an invalid data type.</dd>
  <dt>Callback called exit</dt>
  <dd>(F) A subroutine invoked from an external package via <i>call_sv()</i>
      exited by calling exit.</dd>
  <dt>%s() called too early to check prototype</dt>
  <dd>(W prototype) You've called a function that has a prototype before the
      parser saw a definition or declaration for it, and Perl could not check
      that the call conforms to the prototype. You need to either add an early
      prototype declaration for the subroutine in question, or move the
      subroutine definition ahead of the call to get proper prototype checking.
      Alternatively, if you are certain that you're calling the function
      correctly, you may put an ampersand before the name to avoid the warning.
      See perlsub.</dd>
  <dt>Cannot compress integer in pack</dt>
  <dd>(F) An argument to pack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was too large to compress. The
      BER compressed integer format can only be used with positive integers, and
      you attempted to compress Infinity or a very large number (&gt; 1e308).
      See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Cannot compress negative numbers in pack</dt>
  <dd>(F) An argument to pack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was negative. The BER
      compressed integer format can only be used with positive integers. See
      &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Cannot convert a reference to %s to typeglob</dt>
  <dd>(F) You manipulated Perl's symbol table directly, stored a reference in
      it, then tried to access that symbol via conventional Perl syntax. The
      access triggers Perl to autovivify that typeglob, but it there is no legal
      conversion from that type of reference to a typeglob.</dd>
  <dt>Cannot copy to %s</dt>
  <dd>(P) Perl detected an attempt to copy a value to an internal type that
      cannot be directly assigned to.</dd>
  <dt>Cannot find encoding &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(S io) You tried to apply an encoding that did not exist to a filehandle,
      either with <i>open()</i> or <i>binmode()</i>.</dd>
  <dt>Cannot set tied @DB::args</dt>
  <dd>(F) <span class="Li">&quot;caller&quot;</span> tried to set
      <span class="Li">@DB::args</span>, but found it tied. Tying
      <span class="Li">@DB::args</span> is not supported. (Before this error was
      added, it used to crash.)</dd>
  <dt>Cannot tie unreifiable array</dt>
  <dd>(P) You somehow managed to call <span class="Li">&quot;tie&quot;</span> on
      an array that does not keep a reference count on its arguments and cannot
      be made to do so. Such arrays are not even supposed to be accessible to
      Perl code, but are only used internally.</dd>
  <dt>Can only compress unsigned integers in pack</dt>
  <dd>(F) An argument to pack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was not an integer. The BER
      compressed integer format can only be used with positive integers, and you
      attempted to compress something else. See &quot;pack&quot; in
    perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Can't bless non-reference value</dt>
  <dd>(F) Only hard references may be blessed. This is how Perl
      &quot;enforces&quot; encapsulation of objects. See perlobj.</dd>
  <dt>Can't &quot;break&quot; in a loop topicalizer</dt>
  <dd>(F) You called <span class="Li">&quot;break&quot;</span>, but you're in a
      <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> block rather than a
      <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> block. You probably meant to use
      <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;last&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Can't &quot;break&quot; outside a given block</dt>
  <dd>(F) You called <span class="Li">&quot;break&quot;</span>, but you're not
      inside a <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> block.</dd>
  <dt>Can't call method &quot;%s&quot; on an undefined value</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the
      object reference or package name contains an undefined value. Something
      like this will reproduce the error:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $BADREF = undef;
    process $BADREF 1,2,3;
    $BADREF-&gt;process(1,2,3);
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Can't call method &quot;%s&quot; on unblessed reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) A method call must know in what package it's supposed to run. It
      ordinarily finds this out from the object reference you supply, but you
      didn't supply an object reference in this case. A reference isn't an
      object reference until it has been blessed. See perlobj.</dd>
  <dt>Can't call method &quot;%s&quot; without a package or object
    reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the
      object reference or package name contains an expression that returns a
      defined value which is neither an object reference nor a package name.
      Something like this will reproduce the error:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $BADREF = 42;
    process $BADREF 1,2,3;
    $BADREF-&gt;process(1,2,3);
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Can't chdir to %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You called <span class="Li">&quot;perl -x/foo/bar&quot;</span>, but
      <i>/foo/bar</i> is not a directory that you can chdir to, possibly because
      it doesn't exist.</dd>
  <dt>Can't check filesystem of script &quot;%s&quot; for nosuid</dt>
  <dd>(P) For some reason you can't check the filesystem of the script for
      nosuid.</dd>
  <dt>Can't coerce %s to %s in %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) Certain types of SVs, in particular real symbol table entries
      (typeglobs), can't be forced to stop being what they are. So you can't say
      things like:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    *foo += 1;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You CAN say</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $foo = *foo;
    $foo += 1;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">but then <span class="Li">$foo</span> no longer contains a
        glob.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Can't &quot;continue&quot; outside a when block</dt>
  <dd>(F) You called <span class="Li">&quot;continue&quot;</span>, but you're
      not inside a <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;default&quot;</span> block.</dd>
  <dt>Can't create pipe mailbox</dt>
  <dd>(P) An error peculiar to VMS. The process is suffering from exhausted
      quotas or other plumbing problems.</dd>
  <dt>Can't declare %s in &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(F) Only scalar, array, and hash variables may be declared as
      &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot; or &quot;state&quot; variables. They must
      have ordinary identifiers as names.</dd>
  <dt>Can't &quot;default&quot; outside a topicalizer</dt>
  <dd>(F) You have used a <span class="Li">&quot;default&quot;</span> block that
      is neither inside a <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop nor a
      <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> block. (Note that this error is
      issued on exit from the <span class="Li">&quot;default&quot;</span> block,
      so you won't get the error if you use an explicit
      <span class="Li">&quot;continue&quot;</span>.)</dd>
  <dt>Can't do inplace edit: %s is not a regular file</dt>
  <dd>(S inplace) You tried to use the <b>-i</b> switch on a special file, such
      as a file in /dev, a FIFO or an uneditable directory. The file was
      ignored.</dd>
  <dt>Can't do inplace edit on %s: %s</dt>
  <dd>(S inplace) The creation of the new file failed for the indicated
    reason.</dd>
  <dt>Can't do inplace edit without backup</dt>
  <dd>(F) You're on a system such as MS-DOS that gets confused if you try
      reading from a deleted (but still opened) file. You have to say
      <span class="Li">&quot;-i.bak&quot;</span>, or some such.</dd>
  <dt>Can't do inplace edit: %s would not be unique</dt>
  <dd>(S inplace) Your filesystem does not support filenames longer than 14
      characters and Perl was unable to create a unique filename during inplace
      editing with the <b>-i</b> switch. The file was ignored.</dd>
  <dt>Can't do waitpid with flags</dt>
  <dd>(F) This machine doesn't have either <i>waitpid()</i> or <i>wait4()</i>,
      so only <i>waitpid()</i> without flags is emulated.</dd>
  <dt>Can't emulate -%s on #! line</dt>
  <dd>(F) The #! line specifies a switch that doesn't make sense at this point.
      For example, it'd be kind of silly to put a <b>-x</b> on the #! line.</dd>
  <dt>Can't %s %s-endian %ss on this platform</dt>
  <dd>(F) Your platform's byte-order is neither big-endian nor little-endian, or
      it has a very strange pointer size. Packing and unpacking big- or
      little-endian floating point values and pointers may not be possible. See
      &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Can't exec &quot;%s&quot;: %s</dt>
  <dd>(W exec) A <i>system()</i>, <i>exec()</i>, or piped open call could not
      execute the named program for the indicated reason. Typical reasons
      include: the permissions were wrong on the file, the file wasn't found in
      <span class="Li">$ENV{PATH}</span>, the executable in question was
      compiled for another architecture, or the #! line in a script points to an
      interpreter that can't be run for similar reasons. (Or maybe your system
      doesn't support #! at all.)</dd>
  <dt>Can't exec %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl was trying to execute the indicated program for you because
      that's what the #! line said. If that's not what you wanted, you may need
      to mention &quot;perl&quot; on the #! line somewhere.</dd>
  <dt>Can't execute %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used the <b>-S</b> switch, but the copies of the script to execute
      found in the PATH did not have correct permissions.</dd>
  <dt>Can't find an opnumber for &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(F) A string of a form <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::word&quot;</span> was
      given to <i>prototype()</i>, but there is no builtin with the name
      <span class="Li">&quot;word&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Can't find %s character property &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used <span class="Li">&quot;\p{}&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;\P{}&quot;</span> but the character property by
      that name could not be found. Maybe you misspelled the name of the
      property? See &quot;Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}&quot; in
      perluniprops for a complete list of available official properties.</dd>
  <dt>Can't find label %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You said to goto a label that isn't mentioned anywhere that it's
      possible for us to go to. See &quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Can't find %s on PATH</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used the <b>-S</b> switch, but the script to execute could not be
      found in the PATH.</dd>
  <dt>Can't find %s on PATH, '.' not in PATH</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used the <b>-S</b> switch, but the script to execute could not be
      found in the PATH, or at least not with the correct permissions. The
      script exists in the current directory, but PATH prohibits running
    it.</dd>
  <dt>Can't find string terminator %s anywhere before EOF</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl strings can stretch over multiple lines. This message means that
      the closing delimiter was omitted. Because bracketed quotes count nesting
      levels, the following is missing its final parenthesis:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    print q(The character '(' starts a side comment.);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you're getting this error from a here-document, you may
        have included unseen whitespace before or after your closing tag or
        there may not be a linebreak after it. A good programmer's editor will
        have a way to help you find these characters (or lack of characters).
        See perlop for the full details on here-documents.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Can't find Unicode property definition &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(F) You may have tried to use <span class="Li">&quot;\p&quot;</span> which
      means a Unicode property (for example
      <span class="Li">&quot;\p{Lu}&quot;</span> matches all uppercase letters).
      If you did mean to use a Unicode property, see &quot;Properties accessible
      through \p{} and \P{}&quot; in perluniprops for a complete list of
      available properties. If you didn't mean to use a Unicode property, escape
      the <span class="Li">&quot;\p&quot;</span>, either by
      <span class="Li">&quot;\\p&quot;</span> (just the
      <span class="Li">&quot;\p&quot;</span>) or by
      <span class="Li">&quot;\Q\p&quot;</span> (the rest of the string, or until
      <span class="Li">&quot;\E&quot;</span>).</dd>
  <dt>Can't fork: %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) A fatal error occurred while trying to fork while opening a
    pipeline.</dd>
  <dt>Can't fork, trying again in 5 seconds</dt>
  <dd>(W pipe) A fork in a piped open failed with EAGAIN and will be retried
      after five seconds.</dd>
  <dt>Can't get filespec - stale stat buffer?</dt>
  <dd>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS. This arises because of the difference
      between access checks under VMS and under the Unix model Perl assumes.
      Under VMS, access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in the
      stat buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into account.
      Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer contains all the
      necessary information, and passes it, instead of the filespec, to the
      access-checking routine. It will try to retrieve the filespec using the
      device name and FID present in the stat buffer, but this works only if you
      haven't made a subsequent call to the CRTL <i>stat()</i> routine, because
      the device name is overwritten with each call. If this warning appears,
      the name lookup failed, and the access-checking routine gave up and
      returned FALSE, just to be conservative. (Note: The access-checking
      routine knows about the Perl <span class="Li">&quot;stat&quot;</span>
      operator and file tests, so you shouldn't ever see this warning in
      response to a Perl command; it arises only if some internal code takes
      stat buffers lightly.)</dd>
  <dt>Can't get pipe mailbox device name</dt>
  <dd>(P) An error peculiar to VMS. After creating a mailbox to act as a pipe,
      Perl can't retrieve its name for later use.</dd>
  <dt>Can't get SYSGEN parameter value for MAXBUF</dt>
  <dd>(P) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl asked <span class="Li">$GETSYI</span>
      how big you want your mailbox buffers to be, and didn't get an
    answer.</dd>
  <dt>Can't &quot;goto&quot; into the middle of a foreach loop</dt>
  <dd>(F) A &quot;goto&quot; statement was executed to jump into the middle of a
      foreach loop. You can't get there from here. See &quot;goto&quot; in
      perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Can't &quot;goto&quot; out of a pseudo block</dt>
  <dd>(F) A &quot;goto&quot; statement was executed to jump out of what might
      look like a block, except that it isn't a proper block. This usually
      occurs if you tried to jump out of a <i>sort()</i> block or subroutine,
      which is a no-no. See &quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Can't goto subroutine from a sort sub (or similar callback)</dt>
  <dd>(F) The &quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can't be used to jump out of the
      comparison sub for a <i>sort()</i>, or from a similar callback (such as
      the <i>reduce()</i> function in List::Util).</dd>
  <dt>Can't goto subroutine from an eval-%s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The &quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can't be used to jump out of an
      eval &quot;string&quot; or block.</dd>
  <dt>Can't goto subroutine outside a subroutine</dt>
  <dd>(F) The deeply magical &quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can only replace
      one subroutine call for another. It can't manufacture one out of whole
      cloth. In general you should be calling it out of only an AUTOLOAD routine
      anyway. See &quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Can't ignore signal CHLD, forcing to default</dt>
  <dd>(W signal) Perl has detected that it is being run with the SIGCHLD signal
      (sometimes known as SIGCLD) disabled. Since disabling this signal will
      interfere with proper determination of exit status of child processes,
      Perl has reset the signal to its default value. This situation typically
      indicates that the parent program under which Perl may be running (e.g.
      cron) is being very careless.</dd>
  <dt>Can't kill a non-numeric process ID</dt>
  <dd>(F) Process identifiers must be (signed) integers. It is a fatal error to
      attempt to <i>kill()</i> an undefined, empty-string or otherwise
      non-numeric process identifier.</dd>
  <dt>Can't &quot;last&quot; outside a loop block</dt>
  <dd>(F) A &quot;last&quot; statement was executed to break out of the current
      block, except that there's this itty bitty problem called there isn't a
      current block. Note that an &quot;if&quot; or &quot;else&quot; block
      doesn't count as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as doesn't a block given to
      <i>sort()</i>, <i>map()</i> or <i>grep()</i>. You can usually double the
      curlies to get the same effect though, because the inner curlies will be
      considered a block that loops once. See &quot;last&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Can't linearize anonymous symbol table</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl tried to calculate the method resolution order (MRO) of a
      package, but failed because the package stash has no name.</dd>
  <dt>Can't load '%s' for module %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The module you tried to load failed to load a dynamic extension. This
      may either mean that you upgraded your version of perl to one that is
      incompatible with your old dynamic extensions (which is known to happen
      between major versions of perl), or (more likely) that your dynamic
      extension was built against an older version of the library that is
      installed on your system. You may need to rebuild your old dynamic
      extensions.</dd>
  <dt>Can't localize lexical variable %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used local on a variable name that was previously declared as a
      lexical variable using &quot;my&quot; or &quot;state&quot;. This is not
      allowed. If you want to localize a package variable of the same name,
      qualify it with the package name.</dd>
  <dt>Can't localize through a reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) You said something like <span class="Li">&quot;local
      $$ref&quot;</span>, which Perl can't currently handle, because when it
      goes to restore the old value of whatever <span class="Li">$ref</span>
      pointed to after the scope of the <i>local()</i> is finished, it can't be
      sure that <span class="Li">$ref</span> will still be a reference.</dd>
  <dt>Can't locate %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You said to <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span> (or
      <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span>, or
      <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>) a file that couldn't be found.
      Perl looks for the file in all the locations mentioned in
      <span class="Li">@INC</span>, unless the file name included the full path
      to the file. Perhaps you need to set the PERL5LIB or PERL5OPT environment
      variable to say where the extra library is, or maybe the script needs to
      add the library name to <span class="Li">@INC</span>. Or maybe you just
      misspelled the name of the file. See &quot;require&quot; in perlfunc and
      lib.</dd>
  <dt>Can't locate auto/%s.al in @INC</dt>
  <dd>(F) A function (or method) was called in a package which allows autoload,
      but there is no function to autoload. Most probable causes are a misprint
      in a function/method name or a failure to
      <span class="Li">&quot;AutoSplit&quot;</span> the file, say, by doing
      <span class="Li">&quot;make install&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Can't locate loadable object for module %s in @INC</dt>
  <dd>(F) The module you loaded is trying to load an external library, like for
      example, <i>foo.so</i> or <i>bar.dll</i>, but the DynaLoader module was
      unable to locate this library. See DynaLoader.</dd>
  <dt>Can't locate object method &quot;%s&quot; via package &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(F) You called a method correctly, and it correctly indicated a package
      functioning as a class, but that package doesn't define that particular
      method, nor does any of its base classes. See perlobj.</dd>
  <dt>Can't locate package %s for @%s::ISA</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) The <span class="Li">@ISA</span> array contained the name of
      another package that doesn't seem to exist.</dd>
  <dt>Can't locate PerlIO%s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to use in <i>open()</i> a PerlIO layer that does not exist,
      e.g. open(FH, &quot;&gt;:nosuchlayer&quot;, &quot;somefile&quot;).</dd>
  <dt>Can't make list assignment to %ENV on this system</dt>
  <dd>(F) List assignment to <span class="Li">%ENV</span> is not supported on
      some systems, notably VMS.</dd>
  <dt>Can't make loaded symbols global on this platform while loading %s</dt>
  <dd>(W) A module passed the flag 0x01 to <i>DynaLoader::dl_load_file()</i> to
      request that symbols from the stated file are made available globally
      within the process, but that functionality is not available on this
      platform. Whilst the module likely will still work, this may prevent the
      perl interpreter from loading other XS-based extensions which need to link
      directly to functions defined in the C or XS code in the stated file.</dd>
  <dt>Can't modify %s in %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You aren't allowed to assign to the item indicated, or otherwise try
      to change it, such as with an auto-increment.</dd>
  <dt>Can't modify nonexistent substring</dt>
  <dd>(P) The internal routine that does assignment to a <i>substr()</i> was
      handed a NULL.</dd>
  <dt>Can't modify non-lvalue subroutine call</dt>
  <dd>(F) Subroutines meant to be used in lvalue context should be declared as
      such. See &quot;Lvalue subroutines&quot; in perlsub.</dd>
  <dt>Can't msgrcv to read-only var</dt>
  <dd>(F) The target of a msgrcv must be modifiable to be used as a receive
      buffer.</dd>
  <dt>Can't &quot;next&quot; outside a loop block</dt>
  <dd>(F) A &quot;next&quot; statement was executed to reiterate the current
      block, but there isn't a current block. Note that an &quot;if&quot; or
      &quot;else&quot; block doesn't count as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as
      doesn't a block given to <i>sort()</i>, <i>map()</i> or <i>grep()</i>. You
      can usually double the curlies to get the same effect though, because the
      inner curlies will be considered a block that loops once. See
      &quot;next&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Can't open %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to run a perl built with MAD support with the PERL_XMLDUMP
      environment variable set, but the file named by that variable could not be
      opened.</dd>
  <dt>Can't open %s: %s</dt>
  <dd>(S inplace) The implicit opening of a file through use of the
      <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</span> filehandle, either implicitly
      under the <span class="Li">&quot;-n&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;-p&quot;</span> command-line switches, or
      explicitly, failed for the indicated reason. Usually this is because you
      don't have read permission for a file which you named on the command line.
    <p class="Pp">(F) You tried to call perl with the <b>-e</b> switch, but
        <i>/dev/null</i> (or your operating system's equivalent) could not be
        opened.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Can't open a reference</dt>
  <dd>(W io) You tried to open a scalar reference for reading or writing, using
      the 3-arg <i>open()</i> syntax:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    open FH, '&gt;', $ref;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">but your version of perl is compiled without perlio, and this
        form of open is not supported.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Can't open bidirectional pipe</dt>
  <dd>(W pipe) You tried to say <span class="Li">&quot;open(CMD,
      &quot;|cmd|&quot;)&quot;</span>, which is not supported. You can try any
      of several modules in the Perl library to do this, such as IPC::Open2.
      Alternately, direct the pipe's output to a file using &quot;&gt;&quot;,
      and then read it in under a different file handle.</dd>
  <dt>Can't open error file %s as stderr</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line redirection,
      and couldn't open the file specified after '2&gt;' or '2&gt;&gt;' on the
      command line for writing.</dd>
  <dt>Can't open input file %s as stdin</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line redirection,
      and couldn't open the file specified after '&lt;' on the command line for
      reading.</dd>
  <dt>Can't open output file %s as stdout</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line redirection,
      and couldn't open the file specified after '&gt;' or '&gt;&gt;' on the
      command line for writing.</dd>
  <dt>Can't open output pipe (name: %s)</dt>
  <dd>(P) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line redirection,
      and couldn't open the pipe into which to send data destined for
    stdout.</dd>
  <dt>Can't open perl script &quot;%s&quot;: %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The script you specified can't be opened for the indicated reason.
    <p class="Pp">If you're debugging a script that uses #!, and normally relies
        on the shell's <span class="Li">$PATH</span> search, the -S option
        causes perl to do that search, so you don't have to type the path or
        <span class="Li">&quot;`which $scriptname`&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Can't read CRTL environ</dt>
  <dd>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl tried to read an element of
      <span class="Li">%ENV</span> from the CRTL's internal environment array
      and discovered the array was missing. You need to figure out where your
      CRTL misplaced its environ or define <i>PERL_ENV_TABLES</i> (see perlvms)
      so that environ is not searched.</dd>
  <dt>Can't &quot;redo&quot; outside a loop block</dt>
  <dd>(F) A &quot;redo&quot; statement was executed to restart the current
      block, but there isn't a current block. Note that an &quot;if&quot; or
      &quot;else&quot; block doesn't count as a &quot;loopish&quot; block, as
      doesn't a block given to <i>sort()</i>, <i>map()</i> or <i>grep()</i>. You
      can usually double the curlies to get the same effect though, because the
      inner curlies will be considered a block that loops once. See
      &quot;redo&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Can't remove %s: %s, skipping file</dt>
  <dd>(S inplace) You requested an inplace edit without creating a backup file.
      Perl was unable to remove the original file to replace it with the
      modified file. The file was left unmodified.</dd>
  <dt>Can't rename %s to %s: %s, skipping file</dt>
  <dd>(S inplace) The rename done by the <b>-i</b> switch failed for some
      reason, probably because you don't have write permission to the
    directory.</dd>
  <dt>Can't reopen input pipe (name: %s) in binary mode</dt>
  <dd>(P) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl thought stdin was a pipe, and tried to
      reopen it to accept binary data. Alas, it failed.</dd>
  <dt>Can't reset %ENV on this system</dt>
  <dd>(F) You called <span class="Li">&quot;reset('E')&quot;</span> or similar,
      which tried to reset all variables in the current package beginning with
      &quot;E&quot;. In the main package, that includes
      <span class="Li">%ENV</span>. Resetting <span class="Li">%ENV</span> is
      not supported on some systems, notably VMS.</dd>
  <dt>Can't resolve method &quot;%s&quot; overloading &quot;%s&quot; in package
    &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(F)(P) Error resolving overloading specified by a method name (as opposed
      to a subroutine reference): no such method callable via the package. If
      the method name is <span class="Li">&quot;???&quot;</span>, this is an
      internal error.</dd>
  <dt>Can't return %s from lvalue subroutine</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl detected an attempt to return illegal lvalues (such as temporary
      or readonly values) from a subroutine used as an lvalue. This is not
      allowed.</dd>
  <dt>Can't return outside a subroutine</dt>
  <dd>(F) The return statement was executed in mainline code, that is, where
      there was no subroutine call to return out of. See perlsub.</dd>
  <dt>Can't return %s to lvalue scalar context</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to return a complete array or hash from an lvalue
      subroutine, but you called the subroutine in a way that made Perl think
      you meant to return only one value. You probably meant to write
      parentheses around the call to the subroutine, which tell Perl that the
      call should be in list context.</dd>
  <dt>Can't stat script &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(P) For some reason you can't <i>fstat()</i> the script even though you
      have it open already. Bizarre.</dd>
  <dt>Can't take log of %g</dt>
  <dd>(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can't take the logarithm of a negative
      number or zero. There's a Math::Complex package that comes standard with
      Perl, though, if you really want to do that for the negative numbers.</dd>
  <dt>Can't take sqrt of %g</dt>
  <dd>(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can't take the square root of a
      negative number. There's a Math::Complex package that comes standard with
      Perl, though, if you really want to do that.</dd>
  <dt>Can't undef active subroutine</dt>
  <dd>(F) You can't undefine a routine that's currently running. You can,
      however, redefine it while it's running, and you can even undef the
      redefined subroutine while the old routine is running. Go figure.</dd>
  <dt>Can't upgrade %s (%d) to %d</dt>
  <dd>(P) The internal sv_upgrade routine adds &quot;members&quot; to an SV,
      making it into a more specialized kind of SV. The top several SV types are
      so specialized, however, that they cannot be interconverted. This message
      indicates that such a conversion was attempted.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use '%c' after -mname</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to call perl with the <b>-m</b> switch, but you put
      something other than &quot;=&quot; after the module name.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use anonymous symbol table for method lookup</dt>
  <dd>(F) The internal routine that does method lookup was handed a symbol table
      that doesn't have a name. Symbol tables can become anonymous for example
      by undefining stashes: <span class="Li">&quot;undef
      %Some::Package::&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use an undefined value as %s reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) A value used as either a hard reference or a symbolic reference must
      be a defined value. This helps to delurk some insidious errors.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use bareword (&quot;%s&quot;) as %s ref while &quot;strict
    refs&quot; in use</dt>
  <dd>(F) Only hard references are allowed by &quot;strict refs&quot;. Symbolic
      references are disallowed. See perlref.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use %! because Errno.pm is not available</dt>
  <dd>(F) The first time the <span class="Li">&quot;%!&quot;</span> hash is
      used, perl automatically loads the Errno.pm module. The Errno module is
      expected to tie the %! hash to provide symbolic names for
      <span class="Li">$!</span> errno values.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use both '&lt;' and '&gt;' after type '%c' in %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) A type cannot be forced to have both big-endian and little-endian
      byte-order at the same time, so this combination of modifiers is not
      allowed. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use %s for loop variable</dt>
  <dd>(F) Only a simple scalar variable may be used as a loop variable on a
      foreach.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use global %s in &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to declare a magical variable as a lexical variable. This is
      not allowed, because the magic can be tied to only one location (namely
      the global variable) and it would be incredibly confusing to have
      variables in your program that looked like magical variables but
    weren't.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use '%c' in a group with different byte-order in %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You attempted to force a different byte-order on a type that is
      already inside a group with a byte-order modifier. For example you cannot
      force little-endianness on a type that is inside a big-endian group.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use &quot;my %s&quot; in sort comparison</dt>
  <dd>(F) The global variables <span class="Li">$a</span> and
      <span class="Li">$b</span> are reserved for sort comparisons. You
      mentioned <span class="Li">$a</span> or <span class="Li">$b</span> in the
      same line as the &lt;=&gt; or cmp operator, and the variable had earlier
      been declared as a lexical variable. Either qualify the sort variable with
      the package name, or rename the lexical variable.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use %s ref as %s ref</dt>
  <dd>(F) You've mixed up your reference types. You have to dereference a
      reference of the type needed. You can use the <i>ref()</i> function to
      test the type of the reference, if need be.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use string (&quot;%s&quot;) as %s ref while &quot;strict refs&quot;
    in use</dt>
  <dd>(F) You've told Perl to dereference a string, something which
      <span class="Li">&quot;use strict&quot;</span> blocks to prevent it
      happening accidentally. See &quot;Symbolic references&quot; in perlref.
      This can be triggered by an <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span> in a double-quoted string
      immediately before interpolating a variable, for example in
      <span class="Li">&quot;user @$twitter_id&quot;</span>, which says to treat
      the contents of <span class="Li">$twitter_id</span> as an array reference;
      use a <span class="Li">&quot;\&quot;</span> to have a literal
      <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span> symbol followed by the contents of
      <span class="Li">$twitter_id</span>: <span class="Li">&quot;user
      \@$twitter_id&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use subscript on %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The compiler tried to interpret a bracketed expression as a subscript.
      But to the left of the brackets was an expression that didn't look like a
      hash or array reference, or anything else subscriptable.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use \%c to mean $%c in expression</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) In an ordinary expression, backslash is a unary operator that
      creates a reference to its argument. The use of backslash to indicate a
      backreference to a matched substring is valid only as part of a regular
      expression pattern. Trying to do this in ordinary Perl code produces a
      value that prints out looking like <i>SCALAR</i>(0xdecaf). Use the
      <span class="Li">$1</span> form instead.</dd>
  <dt>Can't weaken a nonreference</dt>
  <dd>(F) You attempted to weaken something that was not a reference. Only
      references can be weakened.</dd>
  <dt>Can't &quot;when&quot; outside a topicalizer</dt>
  <dd>(F) You have used a <i>when()</i> block that is neither inside a
      <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop nor a
      <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> block. (Note that this error is
      issued on exit from the <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> block, so
      you won't get the error if the match fails, or if you use an explicit
      <span class="Li">&quot;continue&quot;</span>.)</dd>
  <dt>Can't x= to read-only value</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to repeat a constant value (often the undefined value) with
      an assignment operator, which implies modifying the value itself. Perhaps
      you need to copy the value to a temporary, and repeat that.</dd>
  <dt>Character following &quot;\c&quot; must be ASCII</dt>
  <dd>(F)(W deprecated, syntax) In
      <span class="Li">&quot;\c</span><i>X</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span>,
      <i>X</i> must be an ASCII character. It is planned to make this fatal in
      all instances in Perl v5.20. In the cases where it isn't fatal, the
      character this evaluates to is derived by exclusive or'ing the code point
      of this character with 0x40.
    <p class="Pp">Note that non-alphabetic ASCII characters are discouraged here
        as well, and using non-printable ones will be deprecated starting in
        v5.18.</p>

  <dd>(W threads) Within a thread-enabled program, you tried to call
      <i>cond_broadcast()</i> on a variable which wasn't locked. The

      before the other thread has a chance to enter the wait, it is usual for
      the signaling thread first to wait for a lock on variable. This lock
      attempt will only succeed after the other thread has entered

  <dt>Constant is not %s reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) A constant value (perhaps declared using the
      <span class="Li">&quot;use constant&quot;</span> pragma) is being
      dereferenced, but it amounts to the wrong type of reference. The message
      indicates the type of reference that was expected. This usually indicates

      <span class="Li">&amp;foo</span> syntax or through a reference. Some
      subroutines in this package cannot yet be called that way, but must be

      the perlbug utility.</dd>
  <dt>Count after length/code in unpack</dt>

  <dt>Deep recursion on subroutine &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(W recursion) This subroutine has called itself (directly or indirectly)
      100 times more than it has returned. This probably indicates an infinite
      recursion, unless you're writing strange benchmark programs, in which case
      it indicates something else.
    <p class="Pp">This threshold can be changed from 100, by recompiling the
        <i>perl</i> binary, setting the C pre-processor macro

  </dd>
  <dt>defined(@array) is deprecated</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) <i>defined()</i> is not usually useful on arrays because it

  <dt>defined(%hash) is deprecated</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) <span class="Li">&quot;defined()&quot;</span> is not
      usually right on hashes and has been discouraged since 5.004.
    <p class="Pp">Although <span class="Li">&quot;defined %hash&quot;</span> is
        false on a plain not-yet-used hash, it becomes true in several
        non-obvious circumstances, including iterators, weak references, stash
        names, even remaining true after <span class="Li">&quot;undef

  <dt>Deprecated use of <i>my()</i> in false conditional</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) You used a declaration similar to <span class="Li">&quot;my
      $x if 0&quot;</span>. There has been a long-standing bug in Perl that
      causes a lexical variable not to be cleared at scope exit when its
      declaration includes a false conditional. Some people have exploited this
      bug to achieve a kind of static variable. Since we intend to fix this bug,
      we don't want people relying on this behavior. You can achieve a similar
      static effect by declaring the variable in a separate block outside the
      function, eg
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub f { my $x if 0; return $x++ }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">becomes</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    { my $x; sub f { return $x++ } }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Beginning with perl 5.9.4, you can also use
        <span class="Li">&quot;state&quot;</span> variables to have lexicals
        that are initialized only once (see feature):</p>

  <dt>DESTROY created new reference to dead object '%s'</dt>
  <dd>(F) A <i>DESTROY()</i> method created a new reference to the object which

  <dt>%s did not return a true value</dt>
  <dd>(F) A required (or used) file must return a true value to indicate that it

      traditional to end such a file with a &quot;1;&quot;, though any true
      value would do. See &quot;require&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>(Did you mean &amp;%s instead?)</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You probably referred to an imported subroutine &amp;FOO as
      <span class="Li">$FOO</span> or some such.</dd>
  <dt>(Did you mean &quot;local&quot; instead of &quot;our&quot;?)</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) Remember that &quot;our&quot; does not localize the declared
      global variable. You have declared it again in the same lexical scope,
      which seems superfluous.</dd>
  <dt>(Did you mean $ or @ instead of %?)</dt>
  <dd>(W) You probably said <span class="Li">%hash</span>{$key} when you meant

  <dt>(Do you need to predeclare %s?)</dt>
  <dd>(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
      &quot;%s found where operator expected&quot;. It often means a subroutine
      or module name is being referenced that hasn't been declared yet. This may
      be because of ordering problems in your file, or because of a missing
      &quot;sub&quot;, &quot;package&quot;, &quot;require&quot;, or
      &quot;use&quot; statement. If you're referencing something that isn't
      defined yet, you don't actually have to define the subroutine or package
      before the current location. You can use an empty &quot;sub foo;&quot; or
      &quot;package FOO;&quot; to enter a &quot;forward&quot; declaration.</dd>
  <dt><i>dump()</i> better written as <i>CORE::dump()</i></dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You used the obsolescent

  <dt>%ENV is aliased to %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You're running under taint mode, and the <span class="Li">%ENV</span>
      variable has been aliased to another hash, so it doesn't reflect anymore
      the state of the program's environment. This is potentially insecure.</dd>
  <dt>Error converting file specification %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Because Perl may have to deal with file
      specifications in either VMS or Unix syntax, it converts them to a single
      form when it must operate on them directly. Either you've passed an
      invalid file specification to Perl, or you've found a case the conversion
      routines don't handle. Drat.</dd>
  <dt>Escape literal pattern white space under /x</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) You compiled a regular expression pattern with
      <span class="Li">&quot;/x&quot;</span> to ignore white space, and you
      used, as a literal, one of the characters that Perl plans to eventually
      treat as white space. The character must be escaped somehow, or it will
      work differently on a future Perl that does treat it as white space. The
      easiest way is to insert a backslash immediately before it, or to enclose
      it with square brackets. This change is to bring Perl into conformance
      with Unicode recommendations. Here are the five characters that generate
      this warning: U+0085 NEXT LINE, U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK, U+200F
      RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK, U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR, and U+2029 PARAGRAPH

  <dd>(F) Perl tried to compile a regular expression containing the

      time, as it would when the pattern contains interpolated values. Since
      that is a security risk, it is not allowed. If you insist, you may still
      do this by using the <span class="Li">&quot;re 'eval'&quot;</span> pragma
      or by explicitly building the pattern from an interpolated string at run
      time and using that in an <i>eval()</i>. See &quot;(?{ code })&quot; in

      goto, or a loop control statement.</dd>
  <dt>Exiting format via %s</dt>
  <dd>(W exiting) You are exiting a format by unconventional means, such as a
      goto, or a loop control statement.</dd>
  <dt>Exiting pseudo-block via %s</dt>
  <dd>(W exiting) You are exiting a rather special block construct (like a sort
      block or subroutine) by unconventional means, such as a goto, or a loop
      control statement. See &quot;sort&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Exiting subroutine via %s</dt>
  <dd>(W exiting) You are exiting a subroutine by unconventional means, such as
      a goto, or a loop control statement.</dd>
  <dt>Exiting substitution via %s</dt>
  <dd>(W exiting) You are exiting a substitution by unconventional means, such
      as a return, a goto, or a loop control statement.</dd>
  <dt>Expecting close bracket in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) You wrote something like
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 (?13
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">to denote a capturing group of the form
        <span class="Li">&quot;(?</span><i>PARNO</i><span class="Li">)&quot;</span>,
        but omitted the <span class="Li">&quot;)&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Experimental &quot;%s&quot; subs not enabled</dt>
  <dd>(F) To use lexical subs, you must first enable them:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    no warnings 'experimental::lexical_subs';
    use feature 'lexical_subs';
    my sub foo { ... }
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Explicit blessing to '' (assuming package main)</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You are blessing a reference to a zero length string. This has
      the effect of blessing the reference into the package main. This is
      usually not what you want. Consider providing a default target package,
      e.g. bless($ref, <span class="Li">$p</span> || 'MyPackage');</dd>
  <dt>%s: Expression syntax</dt>
  <dd>(A) You've accidentally run your script through <b>csh</b> instead of
      Perl. Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
    yourself.</dd>
  <dt>%s failed--call queue aborted</dt>
  <dd>(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a UNITCHECK, CHECK,
      INIT, or END subroutine. Processing of the remainder of the queue of such
      routines has been prematurely ended.</dd>
  <dt>False [] range &quot;%s&quot; in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in
    m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(W regexp) A character class range must start and end at a literal
      character, not another character class like
      <span class="Li">&quot;\d&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;[:alpha:]&quot;</span>. The &quot;-&quot; in your
      false range is interpreted as a literal &quot;-&quot;. Consider quoting
      the &quot;-&quot;, &quot;\-&quot;. The &lt;-- HERE shows whereabouts in
      the regular expression the problem was discovered. See perlre.</dd>
  <dt>Fatal VMS error (status=%d) at %s, line %d</dt>
  <dd>(P) An error peculiar to VMS. Something untoward happened in a VMS system
      service or RTL routine; Perl's exit status should provide more details.
      The filename in &quot;at <span class="Li">%s</span>&quot; and the line
      number in &quot;line <span class="Li">%d</span>&quot; tell you which
      section of the Perl source code is distressed.</dd>
  <dt>fcntl is not implemented</dt>
  <dd>(F) Your machine apparently doesn't implement <i>fcntl()</i>. What is
      this, a PDP-11 or something?</dd>
  <dt>FETCHSIZE returned a negative value</dt>
  <dd>(F) A tied array claimed to have a negative number of elements, which is
      not possible.</dd>
  <dt>Field too wide in 'u' format in pack</dt>
  <dd>(W pack) Each line in an uuencoded string starts with a length indicator
      which can't encode values above 63. So there is no point in asking for a
      line length bigger than that. Perl will behave as if you specified
      <span class="Li">&quot;u63&quot;</span> as the format.</dd>
  <dt>Filehandle %s opened only for input</dt>
  <dd>(W io) You tried to write on a read-only filehandle. If you intended it to
      be a read-write filehandle, you needed to open it with &quot;+&lt;&quot;
      or &quot;+&gt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&gt;&quot; instead of with
      &quot;&lt;&quot; or nothing. If you intended only to write the file, use
      &quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;. See &quot;open&quot; in
      perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Filehandle %s opened only for output</dt>
  <dd>(W io) You tried to read from a filehandle opened only for writing, If you
      intended it to be a read/write filehandle, you needed to open it with
      &quot;+&lt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&quot; or &quot;+&gt;&gt;&quot; instead of
      with &quot;&gt;&quot;. If you intended only to read from the file, use
      &quot;&lt;&quot;. See &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc. Another possibility is
      that you attempted to open filedescriptor 0 (also known as STDIN) for
      output (maybe you closed STDIN earlier?).</dd>
  <dt>Filehandle %s reopened as %s only for input</dt>
  <dd>(W io) You opened for reading a filehandle that got the same filehandle id
      as STDOUT or STDERR. This occurred because you closed STDOUT or STDERR
      previously.</dd>
  <dt>Filehandle STDIN reopened as %s only for output</dt>
  <dd>(W io) You opened for writing a filehandle that got the same filehandle id
      as STDIN. This occurred because you closed STDIN previously.</dd>
  <dt>Final $ should be \$ or $name</dt>
  <dd>(F) You must now decide whether the final $ in a string was meant to be a
      literal dollar sign, or was meant to introduce a variable name that
      happens to be missing. So you have to put either the backslash or the
      name.</dd>
  <dt><i>flock()</i> on closed filehandle %s</dt>
  <dd>(W closed) The filehandle you're attempting to <i>flock()</i> got itself
      closed some time before now. Check your control flow. <i>flock()</i>
      operates on filehandles. Are you attempting to call <i>flock()</i> on a
      dirhandle by the same name?</dd>
  <dt>Format not terminated</dt>
  <dd>(F) A format must be terminated by a line with a solitary dot. Perl got to
      the end of your file without finding such a line.</dd>
  <dt>Format %s redefined</dt>
  <dd>(W redefine) You redefined a format. To suppress this warning, say
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    {
        no warnings 'redefine';
        eval &quot;format NAME =...&quot;;
    }
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Found = in conditional, should be ==</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) You said
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    if ($foo = 123)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">when you meant</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    if ($foo == 123)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">(or something like that).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>%s found where operator expected</dt>
  <dd>(S syntax) The Perl lexer knows whether to expect a term or an operator.
      If it sees what it knows to be a term when it was expecting to see an
      operator, it gives you this warning. Usually it indicates that an operator
      or delimiter was omitted, such as a semicolon.</dd>
  <dt>gdbm store returned %d, errno %d, key &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(S) A warning from the GDBM_File extension that a store failed.</dd>
  <dt>gethostent not implemented</dt>
  <dd>(F) Your C library apparently doesn't implement <i>gethostent()</i>,
      probably because if it did, it'd feel morally obligated to return every
      hostname on the Internet.</dd>
  <dt>get%<i>sname()</i> on closed socket %s</dt>
  <dd>(W closed) You tried to get a socket or peer socket name on a closed
      socket. Did you forget to check the return value of your <i>socket()</i>
      call?</dd>
  <dt>getpwnam returned invalid UIC %#o for user &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS. The call to
      <span class="Li">&quot;sys$getuai&quot;</span> underlying the
      <span class="Li">&quot;getpwnam&quot;</span> operator returned an invalid
      UIC.</dd>
  <dt><i>getsockopt()</i> on closed socket %s</dt>
  <dd>(W closed) You tried to get a socket option on a closed socket. Did you
      forget to check the return value of your <i>socket()</i> call? See
      &quot;getsockopt&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>given is experimental</dt>
  <dd>(S experimental::smartmatch) <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>
      depends on both a lexical <span class="Li">$_</span> and smartmatch, both
      of which are experimental, so its behavior may change or even be removed
      in any future release of perl. See the explanation under
      &quot;Experimental Details on given and when&quot; in perlsyn.</dd>
  <dt>Global symbol &quot;%s&quot; requires explicit package name</dt>
  <dd>(F) You've said &quot;use strict&quot; or &quot;use strict vars&quot;,
      which indicates that all variables must either be lexically scoped (using
      &quot;my&quot; or &quot;state&quot;), declared beforehand using
      &quot;our&quot;, or explicitly qualified to say which package the global
      variable is in (using &quot;::&quot;).</dd>
  <dt>glob failed (%s)</dt>
  <dd>(S glob) Something went wrong with the external program(s) used for
      <span class="Li">&quot;glob&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;*.c&gt;&quot;</span>. Usually, this means that
      you supplied a <span class="Li">&quot;glob&quot;</span> pattern that
      caused the external program to fail and exit with a nonzero status. If the
      message indicates that the abnormal exit resulted in a coredump, this may
      also mean that your csh (C shell) is broken. If so, you should change all
      of the csh-related variables in config.sh: If you have tcsh, make the
      variables refer to it as if it were csh (e.g.
      <span class="Li">&quot;full_csh='/usr/bin/tcsh'&quot;</span>); otherwise,
      make them all empty (except that <span class="Li">&quot;d_csh&quot;</span>
      should be <span class="Li">'undef'</span>) so that Perl will think csh is
      missing. In either case, after editing config.sh, run
      <span class="Li">&quot;./Configure -S&quot;</span> and rebuild Perl.</dd>
  <dt>Glob not terminated</dt>
  <dd>(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting a
      term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and not
      finding it. Chances are you left some needed parentheses out earlier in
      the line, and you really meant a &quot;less than&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>gmtime(%f) too large</dt>
  <dd>(W overflow) You called <span class="Li">&quot;gmtime&quot;</span> with a
      number that was larger than it can reliably handle and
      <span class="Li">&quot;gmtime&quot;</span> probably returned the wrong
      date. This warning is also triggered with NaN (the special not-a-number
      value).</dd>
  <dt>gmtime(%f) too small</dt>
  <dd>(W overflow) You called <span class="Li">&quot;gmtime&quot;</span> with a
      number that was smaller than it can reliably handle and
      <span class="Li">&quot;gmtime&quot;</span> probably returned the wrong
      date.</dd>
  <dt>Got an error from DosAllocMem</dt>
  <dd>(P) An error peculiar to OS/2. Most probably you're using an obsolete
      version of Perl, and this should not happen anyway.</dd>
  <dt>goto must have label</dt>
  <dd>(F) Unlike with &quot;next&quot; or &quot;last&quot;, you're not allowed
      to goto an unspecified destination. See &quot;goto&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Goto undefined subroutine%s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to call a subroutine with <span class="Li">&quot;goto
      &amp;sub&quot;</span> syntax, but the indicated subroutine hasn't been
      defined, or if it was, it has since been undefined.</dd>
  <dt>()-group starts with a count</dt>
  <dd>(F) A ()-group started with a count. A count is supposed to follow
      something: a template character or a ()-group. See &quot;pack&quot; in
      perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Group name must start with a non-digit word character in regex; marked by
    &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) Group names must follow the rules for perl identifiers, meaning they
      must start with a non-digit word character. A common cause of this error
      is using (?&amp;0) instead of (?0). See perlre.</dd>
  <dt>%s had compilation errors.</dt>
  <dd>(F) The final summary message when a <span class="Li">&quot;perl
      -c&quot;</span> fails.</dd>
  <dt>Had to create %s unexpectedly</dt>
  <dd>(S internal) A routine asked for a symbol from a symbol table that ought
      to have existed already, but for some reason it didn't, and had to be
      created on an emergency basis to prevent a core dump.</dd>
  <dt>Hash %%s missing the % in argument %d of %s()</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) Really old Perl let you omit the % on hash names in some
      spots. This is now heavily deprecated.</dd>
  <dt>%s has too many errors</dt>
  <dd>(F) The parser has given up trying to parse the program after 10 errors.
      Further error messages would likely be uninformative.</dd>
  <dt>Hexadecimal number &gt; 0xffffffff non-portable</dt>
  <dd>(W portable) The hexadecimal number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
      (4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems. See perlport for
      more on portability concerns.</dd>
  <dt>-i used with no filenames on the command line, reading from STDIN</dt>
  <dd>(S inplace) The <span class="Li">&quot;-i&quot;</span> option was passed
      on the command line, indicating that the script is intended to edit files
      inplace, but no files were given. This is usually a mistake, since editing
      STDIN inplace doesn't make sense, and can be confusing because it can make
      perl look like it is hanging when it is really just trying to read from
      STDIN. You should either pass a filename to edit, or remove
      <span class="Li">&quot;-i&quot;</span> from the command line. See perlrun
      for more details.</dd>
  <dt>Identifier too long</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl limits identifiers (names for variables, functions, etc.) to
      about 250 characters for simple names, and somewhat more for compound
      names (like <span class="Li">$A::B</span>). You've exceeded Perl's limits.
      Future versions of Perl are likely to eliminate these arbitrary
      limitations.</dd>
  <dt>Ignoring zero length \N{} in character class in regex; marked by &lt;--
    HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(W regexp) Named Unicode character escapes
      <span class="Li">&quot;(\N{...})&quot;</span> may return a zero-length
      sequence. When such an escape is used in a character class its behaviour
      is not well defined. Check that the correct escape has been used, and the
      correct charname handler is in scope.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal binary digit %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used a digit other than 0 or 1 in a binary number.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal binary digit %s ignored</dt>
  <dd>(W digit) You may have tried to use a digit other than 0 or 1 in a binary
      number. Interpretation of the binary number stopped before the offending
      digit.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal character after '_' in prototype for %s : %s</dt>
  <dd>(W illegalproto) An illegal character was found in a prototype
      declaration. Legal characters in prototypes are $, @, %, *, ;, [, ],
      &amp;, \, and +.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal character \%o (carriage return)</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl normally treats carriage returns in the program text as it would
      any other whitespace, which means you should never see this error when
      Perl was built using standard options. For some reason, your version of
      Perl appears to have been built without this support. Talk to your Perl
      administrator.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal character in prototype for %s : %s</dt>
  <dd>(W illegalproto) An illegal character was found in a prototype
      declaration. Legal characters in prototypes are $, @, %, *, ;, [, ],
      &amp;, \, and +.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal declaration of anonymous subroutine</dt>
  <dd>(F) When using the <span class="Li">&quot;sub&quot;</span> keyword to
      construct an anonymous subroutine, you must always specify a block of
      code. See perlsub.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal declaration of subroutine %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) A subroutine was not declared correctly. See perlsub.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal division by zero</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to divide a number by 0. Either something was wrong in your
      logic, or you need to put a conditional in to guard against meaningless
      input.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal hexadecimal digit %s ignored</dt>
  <dd>(W digit) You may have tried to use a character other than 0 - 9 or A - F,
      a - f in a hexadecimal number. Interpretation of the hexadecimal number
      stopped before the illegal character.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal modulus zero</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to divide a number by 0 to get the remainder. Most numbers
      don't take to this kindly.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal number of bits in vec</dt>
  <dd>(F) The number of bits in <i>vec()</i> (the third argument) must be a
      power of two from 1 to 32 (or 64, if your platform supports that).</dd>
  <dt>Illegal octal digit %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used an 8 or 9 in an octal number.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal octal digit %s ignored</dt>
  <dd>(W digit) You may have tried to use an 8 or 9 in an octal number.
      Interpretation of the octal number stopped before the 8 or 9.</dd>
  <dt>Illegal pattern in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) You wrote something like
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 (?+foo)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;+&quot;</span> is valid only when
        followed by digits, indicating a capturing group. See
        <span class="Li">&quot;(?</span><i>PARNO</i><span class="Li">)&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Illegal switch in PERL5OPT: -%c</dt>
  <dd>(X) The PERL5OPT environment variable may only be used to set the
      following switches: <b>-[CDIMUdmtw]</b>.</dd>
  <dt>Ill-formed CRTL environ value &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl tried to read the CRTL's
      internal environ array, and encountered an element without the
      <span class="Li">&quot;=&quot;</span> delimiter used to separate keys from
      values. The element is ignored.</dd>
  <dt>Ill-formed message in prime_env_iter: |%s|</dt>
  <dd>(W internal) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl tried to read a logical name
      or CLI symbol definition when preparing to iterate over
      <span class="Li">%ENV</span>, and didn't see the expected delimiter
      between key and value, so the line was ignored.</dd>
  <dt>(in cleanup) %s</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) This prefix usually indicates that a <i>DESTROY()</i> method
      raised the indicated exception. Since destructors are usually called by
      the system at arbitrary points during execution, and often a vast number
      of times, the warning is issued only once for any number of failures that
      would otherwise result in the same message being repeated.
    <p class="Pp">Failure of user callbacks dispatched using the
        <span class="Li">&quot;G_KEEPERR&quot;</span> flag could also result in
        this warning. See &quot;G_KEEPERR&quot; in perlcall.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>In '(*VERB...)', splitting the initial '(*' is deprecated in regex; marked

  <dd>(D regexp, deprecated) The two-character sequence

  <dd>(F) There was a syntax error within the <span class="Li">&quot;(?[
      ])&quot;</span>. This can happen if the expression inside the construct
      was completely empty, or if there are too many or few operands for the
      number of operators. Perl is not smart enough to give you a more precise
      indication as to what is wrong.</dd>
  <dt>Inconsistent hierarchy during C3 merge of class '%s': merging failed on

      documentation in mro for more information.</dd>
  <dt>In EBCDIC the v-string components cannot exceed 2147483647</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to EBCDIC. Internally, v-strings are stored as

      encoding is limited to code points no larger than 2147483647
    (0x7FFFFFFF).</dd>
  <dt>Infinite recursion in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used a pattern that references itself without consuming any input
      text. You should check the pattern to ensure that recursive patterns
      either consume text or fail.
    <p class="Pp">The &lt;-- HERE shows whereabouts in the regular expression

  <dt>Initialization of state variables in list context currently forbidden</dt>
  <dd>(F) Currently the implementation of &quot;state&quot; only permits the

      <span class="Li">&quot;state ($a) = 42&quot;</span> as
      <span class="Li">&quot;state $a = 42&quot;</span> to change from list to

      foo()&quot;</span> will be supported in a future perl release.</dd>
  <dt>Insecure dependency in %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to do something that the tainting mechanism didn't like. The
      tainting mechanism is turned on when you're running setuid or setgid, or
      when you specify <b>-T</b> to turn it on explicitly. The tainting
      mechanism labels all data that's derived directly or indirectly from the
      user, who is considered to be unworthy of your trust. If any such data is
      used in a &quot;dangerous&quot; operation, you get this error. See perlsec

      or <span class="Li">$ENV{TERM}</span> are derived from data supplied (or
      potentially supplied) by the user. The script must set the path to a known
      value, using trustworthy data. See perlsec.</dd>
  <dt>Insecure user-defined property %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl detected tainted data when trying to compile a regular expression
      that contains a call to a user-defined character property function, i.e.
      <span class="Li">&quot;\p{IsFoo}&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;\p{InFoo}&quot;</span>. See &quot;User-Defined
      Character Properties&quot; in perlunicode and perlsec.</dd>
  <dt>Integer overflow in format string for %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The indexes and widths specified in the format string of
      <span class="Li">&quot;printf()&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf()&quot;</span> are too large. The numbers
      must not overflow the size of integers for your architecture.</dd>
  <dt>Integer overflow in %s number</dt>
  <dd>(S overflow) The hexadecimal, octal or binary number you have specified
      either as a literal or as an argument to <i>hex()</i> or <i>oct()</i> is
      too big for your architecture, and has been converted to a floating point
      number. On a 32-bit architecture the largest hexadecimal, octal or binary
      number representable without overflow is 0xFFFFFFFF, 037777777777, or
      0b11111111111111111111111111111111 respectively. Note that Perl
      transparently promotes all numbers to a floating point representation
      internally--subject to loss of precision errors in subsequent
    operations.</dd>
  <dt>Integer overflow in srand</dt>
  <dd>(S overflow) The number you have passed to srand is too big to fit in your
      architecture's integer representation. The number has been replaced with
      the largest integer supported (0xFFFFFFFF on 32-bit architectures). This
      means you may be getting less randomness than you expect, because
      different random seeds above the maximum will return the same sequence of
      random numbers.</dd>
  <dt>Integer overflow in version</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>Integer overflow in version %d</dt>
  <dd>(W overflow) Some portion of a version initialization is too large for the
      size of integers for your architecture. This is not a warning because
      there is no rational reason for a version to try and use an element larger
      than typically 2**32. This is usually caused by trying to use some odd
      mathematical operation as a version, like 100/9.</dd>

  <dt>Internal inconsistency in tracking vforks</dt>
  <dd>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl keeps track of the number of times
      you've called <span class="Li">&quot;fork&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;exec&quot;</span>, to determine whether the current
      call to <span class="Li">&quot;exec&quot;</span> should affect the current
      script or a subprocess (see &quot;exec LIST&quot; in perlvms). Somehow,
      this count has become scrambled, so Perl is making a guess and treating
      this <span class="Li">&quot;exec&quot;</span> as a request to terminate
      the Perl script and execute the specified command.</dd>

  <dt>Invalid strict version format (%s)</dt>
  <dd>(F) A version number did not meet the &quot;strict&quot; criteria for
      versions. A &quot;strict&quot; version number is a positive decimal number
      (integer or decimal-fraction) without exponentiation or else a
      dotted-decimal v-string with a leading 'v' character and at least three
      components. The parenthesized text indicates which criteria were not met.
      See the version module for more details on allowed version formats.</dd>

        used to be silently ignored.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Invalid version format (%s)</dt>
  <dd>(F) A version number did not meet the &quot;lax&quot; criteria for
      versions. A &quot;lax&quot; version number is a positive decimal number
      (integer or decimal-fraction) without exponentiation or else a
      dotted-decimal v-string. If the v-string has fewer than three components,
      it must have a leading 'v' character. Otherwise, the leading 'v' is
      optional. Both decimal and dotted-decimal versions may have a trailing
      &quot;alpha&quot; component separated by an underscore character after a
      fractional or dotted-decimal component. The parenthesized text indicates
      which criteria were not met. See the version module for more details on
      allowed version formats.</dd>
  <dt>Invalid version object</dt>
  <dd>(F) The internal structure of the version object was invalid. Perhaps the

  <dt>IO layers (like '%s') unavailable</dt>
  <dd>(F) Your Perl has not been configured to have PerlIO, and therefore you

  <dd>(D deprecated, syntax) The special variable <span class="Li">$*</span>,
      deprecated in older perls, has been removed as of 5.9.0 and is no longer
      supported. In previous versions of perl the use of
      <span class="Li">$*</span> enabled or disabled multi-line matching within
      a string.
    <p class="Pp">Instead of using <span class="Li">$*</span> you should use the

        <span class="Li">&quot;/m&quot;</span> for a lexical scope (even a whole
        file) with <span class="Li">&quot;use re '/m'&quot;</span>. (In older

  <dt>leaving effective %s failed</dt>
  <dd>(F) While under the <span class="Li">&quot;use filetest&quot;</span>
      pragma, switching the real and effective uids or gids failed.</dd>
  <dt>length/code after end of string in unpack</dt>
  <dd>(F) While unpacking, the string buffer was already used up when an unpack
      length/code combination tried to obtain more data. This results in an
      undefined value for the length. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt><i>length()</i> used on %s</dt>

  <dd>(F) An extension is attempting to insert text into the current parse
      (using lex_stuff_pvn or similar), but tried to insert a character that
      couldn't be part of the current input. This is an inherent pitfall of the
      stuffing mechanism, and one of the reasons to avoid it. Where it is
      necessary to stuff, stuffing only plain ASCII is recommended.</dd>
  <dt>Lexing code internal error (%s)</dt>
  <dd>(F) Lexing code supplied by an extension violated the lexer's API in a

  <dt><i>listen()</i> on closed socket %s</dt>
  <dd>(W closed) You tried to do a listen on a closed socket. Did you forget to
      check the return value of your <i>socket()</i> call? See
      &quot;listen&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>List form of piped open not implemented</dt>
  <dd>(F) On some platforms, notably Windows, the three-or-more-arguments form
      of <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> does not support pipes, such
      as <span class="Li">&quot;open($pipe, '|-', @args)&quot;</span>. Use the

      arg2...')&quot;</span> form instead.</dd>
  <dt>localtime(%f) too large</dt>
  <dd>(W overflow) You called <span class="Li">&quot;localtime&quot;</span> with
      a number that was larger than it can reliably handle and
      <span class="Li">&quot;localtime&quot;</span> probably returned the wrong
      date. This warning is also triggered with NaN (the special not-a-number
      value).</dd>
  <dt>localtime(%f) too small</dt>
  <dd>(W overflow) You called <span class="Li">&quot;localtime&quot;</span> with
      a number that was smaller than it can reliably handle and
      <span class="Li">&quot;localtime&quot;</span> probably returned the wrong
      date.</dd>
  <dt>Lookbehind longer than %d not implemented in regex m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) There is currently a limit on the length of string which lookbehind
      can handle. This restriction may be eased in a future release.</dd>
  <dt>Lost precision when %s %f by 1</dt>
  <dd>(W imprecision) The value you attempted to increment or decrement by one
      is too large for the underlying floating point representation to store
      accurately, hence the target of <span class="Li">&quot;++&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;--&quot;</span> is unchanged. Perl issues this
      warning because it has already switched from integers to floating point
      when values are too large for integers, and now even floating point is
      insufficient. You may wish to switch to using Math::BigInt
    explicitly.</dd>
  <dt><i>lstat()</i> on filehandle%s</dt>
  <dd>(W io) You tried to do an lstat on a filehandle. What did you mean by
      that? <i>lstat()</i> makes sense only on filenames. (Perl did a
      <i>fstat()</i> instead on the filehandle.)</dd>
  <dt>lvalue attribute %s already-defined subroutine</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) Although attributes.pm allows this, turning the lvalue attribute
      on or off on a Perl subroutine that is already defined does not always
      work properly. It may or may not do what you want, depending on what code
      is inside the subroutine, with exact details subject to change between
      Perl versions. Only do this if you really know what you are doing.</dd>
  <dt>lvalue attribute ignored after the subroutine has been defined</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) Using the <span class="Li">&quot;:lvalue&quot;</span> declarative
      syntax to make a Perl subroutine an lvalue subroutine after it has been
      defined is not permitted. To make the subroutine an lvalue subroutine, add
      the lvalue attribute to the definition, or put the
      <span class="Li">&quot;sub</span> <span class="Li">foo

  <dt>Malformed prototype for %s: %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to use a function with a malformed prototype. The syntax of

      like invalid characters. A more rigorous check is run when the function is
      called.</dd>
  <dt>Malformed UTF-8 character (%s)</dt>
  <dd>(S utf8)(F) Perl detected a string that didn't comply with UTF-8 encoding
      rules, even though it had the UTF8 flag on.
    <p class="Pp">One possible cause is that you set the UTF8 flag yourself for
        data that you thought to be in UTF-8 but it wasn't (it was for example
        legacy 8-bit data). To guard against this, you can use

  <dt>Maximal count of pending signals (%u) exceeded</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl aborted due to too high a number of signals pending. This usually
      indicates that your operating system tried to deliver signals too fast
      (with a very high priority), starving the perl process from resources it

  <dt>Missing braces on \N{} in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) Wrong syntax of character name literal
      <span class="Li">&quot;\N{charname}&quot;</span> within double-quotish
      context. This can also happen when there is a space (or comment) between
      the <span class="Li">&quot;\N&quot;</span> and the
      <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span> in a regex with the
      <span class="Li">&quot;/x&quot;</span> modifier. This modifier does not
      change the requirement that the brace immediately follow the
      <span class="Li">&quot;\N&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Missing braces on \o{}</dt>
  <dd>(F) A <span class="Li">&quot;\o&quot;</span> must be followed immediately

  <dt>Missing comma after first argument to %s function</dt>
  <dd>(F) While certain functions allow you to specify a filehandle or an

  <dt>Missing command in piped open</dt>
  <dd>(W pipe) You used the <span class="Li">&quot;open(FH, &quot;|
      command&quot;)&quot;</span> or <span class="Li">&quot;open(FH,
      &quot;command |&quot;)&quot;</span> construction, but the command was

  <dt>Missing control char name in \c</dt>
  <dd>(F) A double-quoted string ended with &quot;\c&quot;, without the required
      control character name.</dd>
  <dt>Missing name in &quot;%s sub&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(F) The reserved syntax for lexically scoped subroutines requires that
      they have a name with which they can be found.</dd>
  <dt>Missing $ on loop variable</dt>
  <dd>(F) Apparently you've been programming in <b>csh</b> too much. Variables
      are always mentioned with the $ in Perl, unlike in the shells, where it
      can vary from one line to the next.</dd>
  <dt>(Missing operator before %s?)</dt>
  <dd>(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
      &quot;%s found where operator expected&quot;. Often the missing operator
      is a comma.</dd>
  <dt>Missing right brace on \%c{} in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) Missing right brace in <span class="Li">&quot;\x{...}&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;\p{...}&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;\P{...}&quot;</span>, or
      <span class="Li">&quot;\N{...}&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Missing right brace on \N{} or unescaped left brace after \N</dt>
  <dd>(F) <span class="Li">&quot;\N&quot;</span> has two meanings.
    <p class="Pp">The traditional one has it followed by a name enclosed in
        braces, meaning the character (or sequence of characters) given by that
        name. Thus <span class="Li">&quot;\N{ASTERISK}&quot;</span> is another
        way of writing <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span>, valid in both
        double-quoted strings and regular expression patterns. In patterns, it
        doesn't have the meaning an unescaped
        <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> does.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Starting in Perl 5.12.0,
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N&quot;</span> also can have an additional
        meaning (only) in patterns, namely to match a non-newline character.
        (This is short for <span class="Li">&quot;[^\n]&quot;</span>, and like
        <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> but is not affected by the
        <span class="Li">&quot;/s&quot;</span> regex modifier.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">This can lead to some ambiguities. When
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N&quot;</span> is not followed immediately by a
        left brace, Perl assumes the <span class="Li">&quot;[^\n]&quot;</span>
        meaning. Also, if the braces form a valid quantifier such as
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N{3}&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N{5,}&quot;</span>, Perl assumes that this means
        to match the given quantity of non-newlines (in these examples, 3; and 5
        or more, respectively). In all other case, where there is a
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N{&quot;</span> and a matching
        <span class="Li">&quot;}&quot;</span>, Perl assumes that a character
        name is desired.</p>
    <p class="Pp">However, if there is no matching
        <span class="Li">&quot;}&quot;</span>, Perl doesn't know if it was
        mistakenly omitted, or if <span class="Li">&quot;[^\n]{&quot;</span> was
        desired, and raises this error. If you meant the former, add the right
        brace; if you meant the latter, escape the brace with a backslash, like
        so: <span class="Li">&quot;\N\{&quot;</span></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Missing right curly or square bracket</dt>
  <dd>(F) The lexer counted more opening curly or square brackets than closing
      ones. As a general rule, you'll find it's missing near the place you were
      last editing.</dd>
  <dt>(Missing semicolon on previous line?)</dt>
  <dd>(S syntax) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message
      &quot;%s found where operator expected&quot;. Don't automatically put a
      semicolon on the previous line just because you saw this message.</dd>
  <dt>Modification of a read-only value attempted</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried, directly or indirectly, to change the value of a constant.
      You didn't, of course, try &quot;2 = 1&quot;, because the compiler catches
      that. But an easy way to do the same thing is:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub mod { $_[0] = 1 }
    mod(2);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Another way is to assign to a <i>substr()</i> that's off the
        end of the string.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Yet another way is to assign to a
        <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop <i>VAR</i> when
        <i>VAR</i> is aliased to a constant in the look <i>LIST</i>:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $x = 1;
    foreach my $n ($x, 2) {
        $n *= 2; # modifies the $x, but fails on attempt to
    }            # modify the 2
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Modification of non-creatable array value attempted, %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to make an array value spring into existence, and the
      subscript was probably negative, even counting from end of the array
      backwards.</dd>
  <dt>Modification of non-creatable hash value attempted, %s</dt>
  <dd>(P) You tried to make a hash value spring into existence, and it couldn't
      be created for some peculiar reason.</dd>
  <dt>Module name must be constant</dt>
  <dd>(F) Only a bare module name is allowed as the first argument to a
      &quot;use&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>Module name required with -%c option</dt>
  <dd>(F) The <span class="Li">&quot;-M&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;-m&quot;</span> options say that Perl should load
      some module, but you omitted the name of the module. Consult perlrun for
      full details about <span class="Li">&quot;-M&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;-m&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>More than one argument to '%s' open</dt>
  <dd>(F) The <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> function has been asked
      to open multiple files. This can happen if you are trying to open a pipe
      to a command that takes a list of arguments, but have forgotten to specify
      a piped open mode. See &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc for details.</dd>
  <dt>msg%s not implemented</dt>
  <dd>(F) You don't have System V message IPC on your system.</dd>
  <dt>Multidimensional syntax %s not supported</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) Multidimensional arrays aren't written like
      <span class="Li">$foo[1,2,3]</span>. They're written like
      <span class="Li">$foo[1][2][3]</span>, as in C.</dd>
  <dt>'/' must follow a numeric type in unpack</dt>
  <dd>(F) You had an unpack template that contained a '/', but this did not
      follow some unpack specification producing a numeric value. See
      &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;my sub&quot; not yet implemented</dt>
  <dd>(F) Lexically scoped subroutines are not yet implemented. Don't try that
      yet.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;my&quot; variable %s can't be in a package</dt>
  <dd>(F) Lexically scoped variables aren't in a package, so it doesn't make
      sense to try to declare one with a package qualifier on the front. Use
      <i>local()</i> if you want to localize a package variable.</dd>
  <dt>Name &quot;%s::%s&quot; used only once: possible typo</dt>
  <dd>(W once) Typographical errors often show up as unique variable names. If
      you had a good reason for having a unique name, then just mention it again
      somehow to suppress the message. The
      <span class="Li">&quot;our&quot;</span> declaration is provided for this
      purpose.
    <p class="Pp">NOTE: This warning detects symbols that have been used only
        once so <span class="Li">$c</span>, <span class="Li">@c</span>,
        <span class="Li">%c</span>, *c, &amp;c, sub c{}, c(), and c (the
        filehandle or format) are considered the same; if a program uses
        <span class="Li">$c</span> only once but also uses any of the others it
        will not trigger this warning.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>\N in a character class must be a named character: \N{...} in regex;
    marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) The new (5.12) meaning of <span class="Li">&quot;\N&quot;</span> as
      <span class="Li">&quot;[^\n]&quot;</span> is not valid in a bracketed
      character class, for the same reason that
      <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> in a character class loses its
      specialness: it matches almost everything, which is probably not what you
      want.</dd>
  <dt>\N{NAME} must be resolved by the lexer in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in
    m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) When compiling a regex pattern, an unresolved named character or
      sequence was encountered. This can happen in any of several ways that
      bypass the lexer, such as using single-quotish context, or an extra
      backslash in double-quotish:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $re = '\N{SPACE}';  # Wrong!
    $re = &quot;\\N{SPACE}&quot;; # Wrong!
    /$re/;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Instead, use double-quotes with a single backslash:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $re = &quot;\N{SPACE}&quot;;  # ok
    /$re/;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The lexer can be bypassed as well by creating the pattern from
        smaller components:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $re = '\N';
    /${re}{SPACE}/;     # Wrong!
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">It's not a good idea to split a construct in the middle like
        this, and it doesn't work here. Instead use the solution above.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Finally, the message also can happen under the
        <span class="Li">&quot;/x&quot;</span> regex modifier when the
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N&quot;</span> is separated by spaces from the
        <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span>, in which case, remove the
      spaces.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    /\N {SPACE}/x;      # Wrong!
    /\N{SPACE}/x;       # ok
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Need exactly 3 octal digits in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) Within
      <span class="Li">&quot;(?[&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;])&quot;</span>, all
      constants interpreted as octal need to be exactly 3 digits long. This
      helps catch some ambiguities. If your constant is too short, add leading
      zeros, like
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 (?[ [ \078 ] ])     # Syntax error!
 (?[ [ \0078 ] ])    # Works
 (?[ [ \007 8 ] ])   # Clearer
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The maximum number this construct can express is
        <span class="Li">&quot;\777&quot;</span>. If you need a larger one, you
        need to use \o{} instead. If you meant two separate things, you need to
        separate them</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 (?[ [ \7776 ] ])        # Syntax error!
 (?[ [ \o{7776} ] ])     # One meaning
 (?[ [ \777 6 ] ])       # Another meaning
 (?[ [ \777 \006 ] ])    # Still another
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Negative '/' count in unpack</dt>
  <dd>(F) The length count obtained from a length/code unpack operation was
      negative. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Negative length</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv operation with a buffer length
      that is less than 0. This is difficult to imagine.</dd>
  <dt>Negative offset to vec in lvalue context</dt>
  <dd>(F) When <span class="Li">&quot;vec&quot;</span> is called in an lvalue
      context, the second argument must be greater than or equal to zero.</dd>
  <dt>Nested quantifiers in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) You can't quantify a quantifier without intervening parentheses. So
      things like ** or +* or ?* are illegal. The &lt;-- HERE shows whereabouts
      in the regular expression the problem was discovered.
    <p class="Pp">Note that the minimal matching quantifiers,
        <span class="Li">&quot;*?&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;+?&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;??&quot;</span> appear to be nested quantifiers,
        but aren't. See perlre.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>%s never introduced</dt>
  <dd>(S internal) The symbol in question was declared but somehow went out of
      scope before it could possibly have been used.</dd>
  <dt>next::method/next::can/maybe::next::method cannot find enclosing
    method</dt>
  <dd>(F) <span class="Li">&quot;next::method&quot;</span> needs to be called
      within the context of a real method in a real package, and it could not
      find such a context. See mro.</dd>
  <dt>No %s allowed while running setuid</dt>
  <dd>(F) Certain operations are deemed to be too insecure for a setuid or
      setgid script to even be allowed to attempt. Generally speaking there will
      be another way to do what you want that is, if not secure, at least
      securable. See perlsec.</dd>
  <dt>No code specified for -%c</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl's <b>-e</b> and <b>-E</b> command-line options require an
      argument. If you want to run an empty program, pass the empty string as a
      separate argument or run a program consisting of a single 0 or 1:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    perl -e &quot;&quot;
    perl -e0
    perl -e1
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>No comma allowed after %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) A list operator that has a filehandle or &quot;indirect object&quot;
      is not allowed to have a comma between that and the following arguments.
      Otherwise it'd be just another one of the arguments.
    <p class="Pp">One possible cause for this is that you expected to have
        imported a constant to your name space with <b>use</b> or <b>import</b>
        while no such importing took place, it may for example be that your
        operating system does not support that particular constant. Hopefully
        you did use an explicit import list for the constants you expect to see;
        please see &quot;use&quot; in perlfunc and &quot;import&quot; in
        perlfunc. While an explicit import list would probably have caught this
        error earlier it naturally does not remedy the fact that your operating
        system still does not support that constant. Maybe you have a typo in
        the constants of the symbol import list of <b>use</b> or <b>import</b>
        or in the constant name at the line where this error was triggered?</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>No command into which to pipe on command line</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl handles its own command line
      redirection, and found a '|' at the end of the command line, so it doesn't
      know where you want to pipe the output from this command.</dd>
  <dt>No DB::DB routine defined</dt>
  <dd>(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the <b>-d</b> switch,
      but for some reason the current debugger (e.g. <i>perl5db.pl</i> or a
      <span class="Li">&quot;Devel::&quot;</span> module) didn't define a
      routine to be called at the beginning of each statement.</dd>
  <dt>No dbm on this machine</dt>
  <dd>(P) This is counted as an internal error, because every machine should
      supply dbm nowadays, because Perl comes with SDBM. See SDBM_File.</dd>
  <dt>No DB::sub routine defined</dt>
  <dd>(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the <b>-d</b> switch,
      but for some reason the current debugger (e.g. <i>perl5db.pl</i> or a
      <span class="Li">&quot;Devel::&quot;</span> module) didn't define a
      <span class="Li">&quot;DB::sub&quot;</span> routine to be called at the
      beginning of each ordinary subroutine call.</dd>
  <dt>No directory specified for -I</dt>
  <dd>(F) The <b>-I</b> command-line switch requires a directory name as part of
      the <i>same</i> argument. Use <b>-Ilib</b>, for instance. <b>-I lib</b>
      won't work.</dd>
  <dt>No error file after 2&gt; or 2&gt;&gt; on command line</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl handles its own command line
      redirection, and found a '2&gt;' or a '2&gt;&gt;' on the command line, but
      can't find the name of the file to which to write data destined for
      stderr.</dd>
  <dt>No group ending character '%c' found in template</dt>

  <dt>No input file after &lt; on command line</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl handles its own command line
      redirection, and found a '&lt;' on the command line, but can't find the

  <dt>No next::method '%s' found for %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) <span class="Li">&quot;next::method&quot;</span> found no further

  <dt>&quot;no&quot; not allowed in expression</dt>
  <dd>(F) The &quot;no&quot; keyword is recognized and executed at compile time,
      and returns no useful value. See perlmod.</dd>
  <dt>No output file after &gt; on command line</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl handles its own command line
      redirection, and found a lone '&gt;' at the end of the command line, so it
      doesn't know where you wanted to redirect stdout.</dd>
  <dt>No output file after &gt; or &gt;&gt; on command line</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl handles its own command line

  <dt>No package name allowed for variable %s in &quot;our&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(F) Fully qualified variable names are not allowed in &quot;our&quot;
      declarations, because that doesn't make much sense under existing

  <dt>No Perl script found in input</dt>
  <dd>(F) You called <span class="Li">&quot;perl -x&quot;</span>, but no line

  <dd>(F) Configure didn't find anything resembling the <i>setreuid()</i> call
      for your system.</dd>
  <dt>No such class field &quot;%s&quot; in variable %s of type %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to access a key from a hash through the indicated typed

      indicated package has restricted the set of allowed keys using the fields
      pragma.</dd>
  <dt>No such class %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You provided a class qualifier in a &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot; or
      &quot;state&quot; declaration, but this class doesn't exist at this point
      in your program.</dd>
  <dt>No such hook: %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You specified a signal hook that was not recognized by Perl.
      Currently, Perl accepts <span class="Li">&quot;__DIE__&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;__WARN__&quot;</span> as valid signal hooks.</dd>
  <dt>No such pipe open</dt>
  <dd>(P) An error peculiar to VMS. The internal routine <i>my_pclose()</i>
      tried to close a pipe which hadn't been opened. This should have been
      caught earlier as an attempt to close an unopened filehandle.</dd>
  <dt>No such signal: SIG%s</dt>
  <dd>(W signal) You specified a signal name as a subscript to
      <span class="Li">%SIG</span> that was not recognized. Say
      <span class="Li">&quot;kill -l&quot;</span> in your shell to see the valid
      signal names on your system.</dd>
  <dt>Not a CODE reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a code value (that is, a

  <dt>Not a GLOB reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a &quot;typeglob&quot;

      instead. You can use the <i>ref()</i> function to find out what kind of
      ref it really was. See perlref.</dd>
  <dt>Not a HASH reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a hash value, but found a
      reference to something else instead. You can use the <i>ref()</i> function
      to find out what kind of ref it really was. See perlref.</dd>
  <dt>Not an ARRAY reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to an array value, but found a
      reference to something else instead. You can use the <i>ref()</i> function
      to find out what kind of ref it really was. See perlref.</dd>
  <dt>Not an unblessed ARRAY reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) You passed a reference to a blessed array to
      <span class="Li">&quot;push&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;shift&quot;</span> or another array function. These
      only accept unblessed array references or arrays beginning explicitly with
      <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Not a SCALAR reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a scalar value, but found a
      reference to something else instead. You can use the <i>ref()</i> function
      to find out what kind of ref it really was. See perlref.</dd>
  <dt>Not a subroutine reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a code value (that is, a
      subroutine), but found a reference to something else instead. You can use
      the <i>ref()</i> function to find out what kind of ref it really was. See
      also perlref.</dd>
  <dt>Not a subroutine reference in overload table</dt>
  <dd>(F) An attempt was made to specify an entry in an overloading table that
      doesn't somehow point to a valid subroutine. See overload.</dd>
  <dt>Not enough arguments for %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The function requires more arguments than you specified.</dd>
  <dt>Not enough format arguments</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) A format specified more picture fields than the next line
      supplied. See perlform.</dd>
  <dt>%s: not found</dt>
  <dd>(A) You've accidentally run your script through the Bourne shell instead
      of Perl. Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
      yourself.</dd>
  <dt>no UTC offset information; assuming local time is UTC</dt>
  <dd>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl was unable to find the local timezone
      offset, so it's assuming that local system time is equivalent to UTC. If
      it's not, define the logical name <i>SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL</i> to
      translate to the number of seconds which need to be added to UTC to get
      local time.</dd>
  <dt>Non-hex character in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) In a regular expression, there was a non-hexadecimal character where a
      hex one was expected, like
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 (?[ [ \xDG ] ])
 (?[ [ \x{DEKA} ] ])
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Non-octal character '%c'. Resolved as &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(W digit) In parsing an octal numeric constant, a character was
      unexpectedly encountered that isn't octal. The resulting value is as
      indicated.</dd>
  <dt>Non-octal character in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) In a regular expression, there was a non-octal character where an
      octal one was expected, like
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 (?[ [ \o{1278} ] ])
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Non-string passed as bitmask</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) A number has been passed as a bitmask argument to
      <i>select()</i>. Use the <i>vec()</i> function to construct the file
      descriptor bitmasks for select. See &quot;select&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>(?[...]) not valid in locale in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) <span class="Li">&quot;(?[...])&quot;</span> cannot be used within the
      scope of a <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;locale&quot;</span> or with
      an <span class="Li">&quot;/l&quot;</span> regular expression modifier, as
      that would require deferring to run-time the calculation of what it should
      evaluate to, and it is regex compile-time only.</dd>
  <dt>Null filename used</dt>
  <dd>(F) You can't require the null filename, especially because on many
      machines that means the current directory! See &quot;require&quot; in
      perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>NULL OP IN RUN</dt>
  <dd>(S debugging) Some internal routine called <i>run()</i> with a null opcode
      pointer.</dd>
  <dt>Null picture in formline</dt>
  <dd>(F) The first argument to formline must be a valid format picture
      specification. It was found to be empty, which probably means you supplied
      it an uninitialized value. See perlform.</dd>
  <dt>Null realloc</dt>
  <dd>(P) An attempt was made to realloc NULL.</dd>
  <dt>NULL regexp argument</dt>
  <dd>(P) The internal pattern matching routines blew it big time.</dd>
  <dt>NULL regexp parameter</dt>
  <dd>(P) The internal pattern matching routines are out of their gourd.</dd>
  <dt>Number too long</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl limits the representation of decimal numbers in programs to about
      250 characters. You've exceeded that length. Future versions of Perl are
      likely to eliminate this arbitrary limitation. In the meantime, try using
      scientific notation (e.g. &quot;1e6&quot; instead of
      &quot;1_000_000&quot;).</dd>
  <dt>Number with no digits</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl was looking for a number but found nothing that looked like a
      number. This happens, for example with
      <span class="Li">&quot;\o{}&quot;</span>, with no number between the
      braces.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;my %s&quot; used in sort comparison</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) The package variables <span class="Li">$a</span> and
      <span class="Li">$b</span> are used for sort comparisons. You used
      <span class="Li">$a</span> or <span class="Li">$b</span> in as an operand
      to the <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;cmp&quot;</span> operator inside a sort comparison
      block, and the variable had earlier been declared as a lexical variable.
      Either qualify the sort variable with the package name, or rename the
      lexical variable.</dd>
  <dt>Octal number &gt; 037777777777 non-portable</dt>
  <dd>(W portable) The octal number you specified is larger than 2**32-1
      (4294967295) and therefore non-portable between systems. See perlport for
      more on portability concerns.</dd>
  <dt>Odd number of arguments for overload::constant</dt>
  <dd>(W overload) The call to overload::constant contained an odd number of
      arguments. The arguments should come in pairs.</dd>
  <dt>Odd number of elements in anonymous hash</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You specified an odd number of elements to initialize a hash,
      which is odd, because hashes come in key/value pairs.</dd>
  <dt>Odd number of elements in hash assignment</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You specified an odd number of elements to initialize a hash,
      which is odd, because hashes come in key/value pairs.</dd>
  <dt>Offset outside string</dt>
  <dd>(F)(W layer) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv/seek operation with an
      offset pointing outside the buffer. This is difficult to imagine. The sole
      exceptions to this are that zero padding will take place when going past
      the end of the string when either
      <span class="Li">&quot;sysread()&quot;</span>ing a file, or when seeking
      past the end of a scalar opened for I/O (in anticipation of future reads
      and to imitate the behaviour with real files).</dd>
  <dt>%s() on unopened %s</dt>
  <dd>(W unopened) An I/O operation was attempted on a filehandle that was never
      initialized. You need to do an <i>open()</i>, a <i>sysopen()</i>, or a
      <i>socket()</i> call, or call a constructor from the FileHandle
    package.</dd>
  <dt>-%s on unopened filehandle %s</dt>
  <dd>(W unopened) You tried to invoke a file test operator on a filehandle that
      isn't open. Check your control flow. See also &quot;-X&quot; in
    perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Strings with code points over 0xFF may not be mapped into in-memory file
    handles</dt>
  <dd>(W utf8) You tried to open a reference to a scalar for read or append
      where the scalar contained code points over 0xFF. In-memory files model
      on-disk files and can only contain bytes.</dd>
  <dt>oops: oopsAV</dt>
  <dd>(S internal) An internal warning that the grammar is screwed up.</dd>
  <dt>oops: oopsHV</dt>
  <dd>(S internal) An internal warning that the grammar is screwed up.</dd>
  <dt>Opening dirhandle %s also as a file</dt>
  <dd>(D io, deprecated) You used <i>open()</i> to associate a filehandle to a
      symbol (glob or scalar) that already holds a dirhandle. Although legal,
      this idiom might render your code confusing and is deprecated.</dd>
  <dt>Opening filehandle %s also as a directory</dt>
  <dd>(D io, deprecated) You used <i>opendir()</i> to associate a dirhandle to a
      symbol (glob or scalar) that already holds a filehandle. Although legal,
      this idiom might render your code confusing and is deprecated.</dd>
  <dt>Operand with no preceding operator in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in
    m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) You wrote something like
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 (?[ \p{Digit} \p{Thai} ])
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">There are two operands, but no operator giving how you want to
        combine them.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Operation &quot;%s&quot;: no method found, %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) An attempt was made to perform an overloaded operation for which no
      handler was defined. While some handlers can be autogenerated in terms of
      other handlers, there is no default handler for any operation, unless the
      <span class="Li">&quot;fallback&quot;</span> overloading key is specified
      to be true. See overload.</dd>
  <dt>Operation &quot;%s&quot; returns its argument for non-Unicode code point
    0x%X</dt>
  <dd>(S utf8, non_unicode) You performed an operation requiring Unicode
      semantics on a code point that is not in Unicode, so what it should do is
      not defined. Perl has chosen to have it do nothing, and warn you.
    <p class="Pp">If the operation shown is &quot;ToFold&quot;, it means that
        case-insensitive matching in a regular expression was done on the code
        point.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you know what you are doing you can turn off this warning
        by <span class="Li">&quot;no warnings 'non_unicode';&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Operation &quot;%s&quot; returns its argument for UTF-16 surrogate
    U+%X</dt>
  <dd>(S utf8, surrogate) You performed an operation requiring Unicode semantics
      on a Unicode surrogate. Unicode frowns upon the use of surrogates for
      anything but storing strings in UTF-16, but semantics are (reluctantly)
      defined for the surrogates, and they are to do nothing for this operation.
      Because the use of surrogates can be dangerous, Perl warns.
    <p class="Pp">If the operation shown is &quot;ToFold&quot;, it means that
        case-insensitive matching in a regular expression was done on the code
        point.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you know what you are doing you can turn off this warning
        by <span class="Li">&quot;no warnings 'surrogate';&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Operator or semicolon missing before %s</dt>
  <dd>(S ambiguous) You used a variable or subroutine call where the parser was
      expecting an operator. The parser has assumed you really meant to use an
      operator, but this is highly likely to be incorrect. For example, if you
      say &quot;*foo *foo&quot; it will be interpreted as if you said &quot;*foo
      * 'foo'&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;our&quot; variable %s redeclared</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You seem to have already declared the same global once before in
      the current lexical scope.</dd>
  <dt>Out of memory!</dt>
  <dd>(X) The <i>malloc()</i> function returned 0, indicating there was
      insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.
      Perl has no option but to exit immediately.
    <p class="Pp">At least in Unix you may be able to get past this by
        increasing your process datasize limits: in csh/tcsh use
        <span class="Li">&quot;limit&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;limit datasize n&quot;</span> (where
        <span class="Li">&quot;n&quot;</span> is the number of kilobytes) to
        check the current limits and change them, and in ksh/bash/zsh use
        <span class="Li">&quot;ulimit -a&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;ulimit -d n&quot;</span>, respectively.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Out of memory during %s extend</dt>
  <dd>(X) An attempt was made to extend an array, a list, or a string beyond the
      largest possible memory allocation.</dd>
  <dt>Out of memory during &quot;large&quot; request for %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The <i>malloc()</i> function returned 0, indicating there was
      insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.
      However, the request was judged large enough (compile-time default is
      64K), so a possibility to shut down by trapping this error is
    granted.</dd>
  <dt>Out of memory during request for %s</dt>
  <dd>(X)(F) The <i>malloc()</i> function returned 0, indicating there was
      insufficient remaining memory (or virtual memory) to satisfy the request.
    <p class="Pp">The request was judged to be small, so the possibility to trap
        it depends on the way perl was compiled. By default it is not trappable.
        However, if compiled for this, Perl may use the contents of
        <span class="Li">$^M</span> as an emergency pool after <i>die()</i>ing
        with this message. In this case the error is trappable <i>once</i>, and
        the error message will include the line and file where the failed
        request happened.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Out of memory during ridiculously large request</dt>
  <dd>(F) You can't allocate more than 2^31+&quot;small amount&quot; bytes. This
      error is most likely to be caused by a typo in the Perl program. e.g.,
      <span class="Li">$arr[time]</span> instead of
      <span class="Li">$arr[$time]</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Out of memory for yacc stack</dt>
  <dd>(F) The yacc parser wanted to grow its stack so it could continue parsing,
      but <i>realloc()</i> wouldn't give it more memory, virtual or
    otherwise.</dd>
  <dt>'.' outside of string in pack</dt>
  <dd>(F) The argument to a '.' in your template tried to move the working
      position to before the start of the packed string being built.</dd>
  <dt>'@' outside of string in unpack</dt>
  <dd>(F) You had a template that specified an absolute position outside the
      string being unpacked. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>'@' outside of string with malformed UTF-8 in unpack</dt>
  <dd>(F) You had a template that specified an absolute position outside the
      string being unpacked. The string being unpacked was also invalid UTF-8.
      See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>overload arg '%s' is invalid</dt>
  <dd>(W overload) The overload pragma was passed an argument it did not
      recognize. Did you mistype an operator?</dd>
  <dt>Overloaded dereference did not return a reference</dt>
  <dd>(F) An object with an overloaded dereference operator was dereferenced,
      but the overloaded operation did not return a reference. See
    overload.</dd>
  <dt>Overloaded qr did not return a REGEXP</dt>
  <dd>(F) An object with a <span class="Li">&quot;qr&quot;</span> overload was
      used as part of a match, but the overloaded operation didn't return a
      compiled regexp. See overload.</dd>
  <dt>%s package attribute may clash with future reserved word: %s</dt>
  <dd>(W reserved) A lowercase attribute name was used that had a
      package-specific handler. That name might have a meaning to Perl itself
      some day, even though it doesn't yet. Perhaps you should use a mixed-case
      attribute name, instead. See attributes.</dd>
  <dt>pack/unpack repeat count overflow</dt>
  <dd>(F) You can't specify a repeat count so large that it overflows your
      signed integers. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>page overflow</dt>
  <dd>(W io) A single call to <i>write()</i> produced more lines than can fit on
      a page. See perlform.</dd>
  <dt>panic: %s</dt>
  <dd>(P) An internal error.</dd>
  <dt>panic: attempt to call %s in %s</dt>
  <dd>(P) One of the file test operators entered a code branch that calls an ACL
      related-function, but that function is not available on this platform.
      Earlier checks mean that it should not be possible to enter this branch on
      this platform.</dd>
  <dt>panic: child pseudo-process was never scheduled</dt>
  <dd>(P) A child pseudo-process in the ithreads implementation on Windows was
      not scheduled within the time period allowed and therefore was not able to
      initialize properly.</dd>
  <dt>panic: ck_grep, type=%u</dt>

  <dd>(P) We popped the context stack to a context with the specified label, and
      then discovered it wasn't a context we know how to do a goto in.</dd>
  <dt>panic: gp_free failed to free glob pointer</dt>
  <dd>(P) The internal routine used to clear a typeglob's entries tried
      repeatedly, but each time something re-created entries in the glob. Most
      likely the glob contains an object with a reference back to the glob and a
      destructor that adds a new object to the glob.</dd>

  <dt>Passing malformed UTF-8 to &quot;%s&quot; is deprecated</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated, utf8) This message indicates a bug either in the Perl core

      punctuation or a digit. But the character was not encoded in legal UTF-8.
      The <span class="Li">%s</span> is replaced by a string that can be used by

        was not dead serious, fortunately: there is a &quot;default locale&quot;
        called &quot;C&quot; that Perl can and will use, and the script will be

  <dt>Possible attempt to put comments in <i>qw()</i> list</dt>
  <dd>(W qw) <i>qw()</i> lists contain items separated by whitespace; as with
      literal strings, comment characters are not ignored, but are instead
      treated as literal data. (You may have used different delimiters than the
      parentheses shown here; braces are also frequently used.)
    <p class="Pp">You probably wrote something like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    @list = qw(

    <p class="Pp">If you really want comments, build your list the old-fashioned

    @list = (
        'a',    # a comment

  </dd>
  <dt>Possible attempt to separate words with commas</dt>
  <dd>(W qw) <i>qw()</i> lists contain items separated by whitespace; therefore
      commas aren't needed to separate the items. (You may have used different
      delimiters than the parentheses shown here; braces are also frequently
      used.)
    <p class="Pp">You probably wrote something like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    qw! a, b, c !;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">which puts literal commas into some of the list items. Write

    <pre>
    qw! a b c !;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Possible memory corruption: %s overflowed 3rd argument</dt>
  <dd>(F) An <i>ioctl()</i> or <i>fcntl()</i> returned more than Perl was
      bargaining for. Perl guesses a reasonable buffer size, but puts a sentinel
      byte at the end of the buffer just in case. This sentinel byte got
      clobbered, and Perl assumes that memory is now corrupted. See
      &quot;ioctl&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Possible precedence problem on bitwise %c operator</dt>
  <dd>(W precedence) Your program uses a bitwise logical operator in conjunction
      with a numeric comparison operator, like this :
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    if ($x &amp; $y == 0) { ... }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This expression is actually equivalent to
        <span class="Li">&quot;$x &amp; ($y == 0)&quot;</span>, due to the
        higher precedence of <span class="Li">&quot;==&quot;</span>. This is
        probably not what you want. (If you really meant to write this, disable
        the warning, or, better, put the parentheses explicitly and write
        <span class="Li">&quot;$x &amp; ($y == 0)&quot;</span>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Possible unintended interpolation of $\ in regex</dt>
  <dd>(W ambiguous) You said something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;m/$\/&quot;</span> in a regex. The regex
      <span class="Li">&quot;m/foo$\s+bar/m&quot;</span> translates to: match
      the word 'foo', the output record separator (see &quot;$\&quot; in
      perlvar) and the letter 's' (one time or more) followed by the word 'bar'.
    <p class="Pp">If this is what you intended then you can silence the warning
        by using <span class="Li">&quot;m/${\}/&quot;</span> (for example:
        <span class="Li">&quot;m/foo${\}s+bar/&quot;</span>).</p>
    <p class="Pp">If instead you intended to match the word 'foo' at the end of
        the line followed by whitespace and the word 'bar' on the next line then
        you can use <span class="Li">&quot;m/$(?)\/&quot;</span> (for example:
        <span class="Li">&quot;m/foo$(?)\s+bar/&quot;</span>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Possible unintended interpolation of %s in string</dt>
  <dd>(W ambiguous) You said something like '@foo' in a double-quoted string but
      there was no array <span class="Li">@foo</span> in scope at the time. If
      you wanted a literal <span class="Li">@foo</span>, then write it as \@foo;
      otherwise find out what happened to the array you apparently lost track
      of.</dd>
  <dt>Precedence problem: open %s should be open(%s)</dt>
  <dd>(S precedence) The old irregular construct
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    open FOO || die;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is now misinterpreted as</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    open(FOO || die);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">because of the strict regularization of Perl 5's grammar into
        unary and list operators. (The old open was a little of both.) You must
        put parentheses around the filehandle, or use the new &quot;or&quot;
        operator instead of &quot;||&quot;.</p>

  <dt>Property '%s' is unknown in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) The named property which you specified via
      <span class="Li">&quot;\p&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;\P&quot;</span> is not one known to Perl. Perhaps
      you misspelled the name? See &quot;Properties accessible through \p{} and
      \P{}&quot; in perluniprops for a complete list of available official
      properties. If it is a user-defined property it must have been defined by
      the time the regular expression is compiled.</dd>
  <dt>Prototype after '%c' for %s : %s</dt>
  <dd>(W illegalproto) A character follows % or @ in a prototype. This is
      useless, since % and @ gobble the rest of the subroutine arguments.</dd>
  <dt>Prototype mismatch: %s vs %s</dt>
  <dd>(S prototype) The subroutine being declared or defined had previously been
      declared or defined with a different function prototype.</dd>
  <dt>Prototype not terminated</dt>
  <dd>(F) You've omitted the closing parenthesis in a function prototype
      definition.</dd>
  <dt>\p{} uses Unicode rules, not locale rules</dt>
  <dd>(W) You compiled a regular expression that contained a Unicode property
      match (<span class="Li">&quot;\p&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;\P&quot;</span>), but the regular expression is
      also being told to use the run-time locale, not Unicode. Instead, use a
      POSIX character class, which should know about the locale's rules. (See
      &quot;POSIX Character Classes&quot; in perlrecharclass.)
    <p class="Pp">Even if the run-time locale is ISO 8859-1 (Latin1), which is a
        subset of Unicode, some properties will give results that are not valid
        for that subset.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here are a couple of examples to help you see what's going on.
        If the locale is ISO 8859-7, the character at code point 0xD7 is the
        &quot;GREEK CAPITAL LETTER CHI&quot;. But in Unicode that code point
        means the &quot;MULTIPLICATION SIGN&quot; instead, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;\p&quot;</span> always uses the Unicode meaning.
        That means that <span class="Li">&quot;\p{Alpha}&quot;</span> won't
        match, but <span class="Li">&quot;[[:alpha:]]&quot;</span> should. Only
        in the Latin1 locale are all the characters in the same positions as
        they are in Unicode. But, even here, some properties give incorrect
        results. An example is
        <span class="Li">&quot;\p{Changes_When_Uppercased}&quot;</span> which is
        true for &quot;LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS&quot;, but since the
        upper case of that character is not in Latin1, in that locale it doesn't
        change when upper cased.</p>

      &quot;xyz&quot; is
      <span class="Li">&quot;/abc(?=(?:xyz){3})/&quot;</span>, not

  <dt>Range iterator outside integer range</dt>
  <dd>(F) One (or both) of the numeric arguments to the range operator

  <dt>Recursive call to Perl_load_module in PerlIO_find_layer</dt>
  <dd>(P) It is currently not permitted to load modules when creating a

      but the last digit is treated as a single character, specified in octal.
      The last digit is the next character in the string. To tell Perl that this
      is indeed what you want, you can use the <span class="Li">&quot;\o{

  <dt>Scalars leaked: %d</dt>
  <dd>(S internal) Something went wrong in Perl's internal bookkeeping of

      bad, especially if the Perl program is intended to be long-running.</dd>
  <dt>Scalar value @%s[%s] better written as $%s[%s]</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) You've used an array slice (indicated by @) to select a single
      element of an array. Generally it's better to ask for a scalar value
      (indicated by $). The difference is that
      <span class="Li">$foo[&amp;bar]</span> always behaves like a scalar, both
      when assigning to it and when evaluating its argument, while
      <span class="Li">@foo[&amp;bar]</span> behaves like a list when you assign
      to it, and provides a list context to its subscript, which can do weird
      things if you're expecting only one subscript.
    <p class="Pp">On the other hand, if you were actually hoping to treat the
        array element as a list, you need to look into how references work,
        because Perl will not magically convert between scalars and lists for

    <p class="Pp">Note that since Perl 5.9.0 a // can also be the

        Therefore code written in Perl 5.9.0 or later that uses the // as the

        ambiguous constructions being wrongly parsed. One way to disambiguate
        the parsing is to put parentheses around the conditional expression,

  <dt>/%s/ should probably be written as &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) You have used a pattern where Perl expected to find a string,

  <dt>Slab leaked from cv %p</dt>
  <dd>(S) If you see this message, then something is seriously wrong with the
      internal bookkeeping of op trees. An op tree needed to be freed after a
      compilation error, but could not be found, so it was leaked instead.</dd>
  <dt>sleep(%u) too large</dt>
  <dd>(W overflow) You called <span class="Li">&quot;sleep&quot;</span> with a
      number that was larger than it can reliably handle and
      <span class="Li">&quot;sleep&quot;</span> probably slept for less time
      than requested.</dd>
  <dt>Smartmatch is experimental</dt>
  <dd>(S experimental::smartmatch) This warning is emitted if you use the
      smartmatch (<span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span>) operator. This is
      currently an experimental feature, and its details are subject to change
      in future releases of Perl. Particularly, its current behavior is noticed
      for being unnecessarily complex and unintuitive, and is very likely to be
      overhauled.</dd>
  <dt>Smart matching a non-overloaded object breaks encapsulation</dt>
  <dd>(F) You should not use the <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span> operator
      on an object that does not overload it: Perl refuses to use the object's
      underlying structure for the smart match.</dd>
  <dt>sort is now a reserved word</dt>
  <dd>(F) An ancient error message that almost nobody ever runs into anymore.
      But before sort was a keyword, people sometimes used it as a
    filehandle.</dd>
  <dt>Sort subroutine didn't return single value</dt>
  <dd>(F) A sort comparison subroutine written in XS must return exactly one
      item. See &quot;sort&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Source filters apply only to byte streams</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to activate a source filter (usually by loading a source
      filter module) within a string passed to
      <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>. This is not permitted under the
      <span class="Li">&quot;unicode_eval&quot;</span> feature. Consider using
      <span class="Li">&quot;evalbytes&quot;</span> instead. See feature.</dd>
  <dt><i>splice()</i> offset past end of array</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You attempted to specify an offset that was past the end of the
      array passed to <i>splice()</i>. Splicing will instead commence at the end
      of the array, rather than past it. If this isn't what you want, try
      explicitly pre-extending the array by assigning $#array =
      <span class="Li">$offset</span>. See &quot;splice&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Split loop</dt>
  <dd>(P) The split was looping infinitely. (Obviously, a split shouldn't
      iterate more times than there are characters of input, which is what
      happened.) See &quot;split&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Statement unlikely to be reached</dt>
  <dd>(W exec) You did an <i>exec()</i> with some statement after it other than
      a <i>die()</i>. This is almost always an error, because <i>exec()</i>
      never returns unless there was a failure. You probably wanted to use
      <i>system()</i> instead, which does return. To suppress this warning, put
      the <i>exec()</i> in a block by itself.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;state&quot; variable %s can't be in a package</dt>
  <dd>(F) Lexically scoped variables aren't in a package, so it doesn't make
      sense to try to declare one with a package qualifier on the front. Use
      <i>local()</i> if you want to localize a package variable.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;state %s&quot; used in sort comparison</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) The package variables <span class="Li">$a</span> and
      <span class="Li">$b</span> are used for sort comparisons. You used
      <span class="Li">$a</span> or <span class="Li">$b</span> in as an operand
      to the <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;cmp&quot;</span> operator inside a sort comparison
      block, and the variable had earlier been declared as a lexical variable.
      Either qualify the sort variable with the package name, or rename the
      lexical variable.</dd>
  <dt><i>stat()</i> on unopened filehandle %s</dt>
  <dd>(W unopened) You tried to use the <i>stat()</i> function on a filehandle
      that was either never opened or has since been closed.</dd>
  <dt>Stub found while resolving method &quot;%s&quot; overloading
    &quot;%s&quot; in package &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(P) Overloading resolution over <span class="Li">@ISA</span> tree may be
      broken by importation stubs. Stubs should never be implicitly created, but
      explicit calls to <span class="Li">&quot;can&quot;</span> may break
    this.</dd>
  <dt>Subroutine &quot;&amp;%s&quot; is not available</dt>
  <dd>(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is
      attempting to capture an outer lexical subroutine that is not currently
      available. This can happen for one of two reasons. First, the lexical
      subroutine may be declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not
      yet been created. (Remember that named subs are created at compile time,
      while anonymous subs are created at run-time.) For example,
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub { my sub a {...} sub f { \&amp;a } }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current
        the &quot;a&quot; sub, since the anonymous subroutine hasn't been
        created yet. Conversely, the following won't give a warning since the
        anonymous subroutine has by now been created and is live:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub { my sub a {...} eval 'sub f { \&amp;a }' }-&gt;();
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a variable
        that has gone out of scope, for example,</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub f {
        my sub a {...}
        sub { eval '\&amp;a' }
    }
    f()-&gt;();
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Here, when the '\&amp;a' in the eval is being compiled, f() is
        not currently being executed, so its &amp;a is not available for
        capture.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;%s&quot; subroutine &amp;%s masks earlier declaration in same
    %s</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) A &quot;my&quot; or &quot;state&quot; subroutine has been
      redeclared in the current scope or statement, effectively eliminating all
      access to the previous instance. This is almost always a typographical
      error. Note that the earlier subroutine will still exist until the end of
      the scope or until all closure references to it are destroyed.</dd>
  <dt>Subroutine %s redefined</dt>
  <dd>(W redefine) You redefined a subroutine. To suppress this warning, say
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    {
        no warnings 'redefine';
        eval &quot;sub name { ... }&quot;;
    }
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Substitution loop</dt>
  <dd>(P) The substitution was looping infinitely. (Obviously, a substitution
      shouldn't iterate more times than there are characters of input, which is
      what happened.) See the discussion of substitution in &quot;Regexp
      Quote-Like Operators&quot; in perlop.</dd>
  <dt>Substitution pattern not terminated</dt>
  <dd>(F) The lexer couldn't find the interior delimiter of an s/// or s{}{}
      construct. Remember that bracketing delimiters count nesting level.
      Missing the leading <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span> from variable
      <span class="Li">$s</span> may cause this error.</dd>
  <dt>Substitution replacement not terminated</dt>
  <dd>(F) The lexer couldn't find the final delimiter of an s/// or s{}{}
      construct. Remember that bracketing delimiters count nesting level.
      Missing the leading <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span> from variable
      <span class="Li">$s</span> may cause this error.</dd>
  <dt>substr outside of string</dt>
  <dd>(W substr)(F) You tried to reference a <i>substr()</i> that pointed
      outside of a string. That is, the absolute value of the offset was larger
      than the length of the string. See &quot;substr&quot; in perlfunc. This
      warning is fatal if substr is used in an lvalue context (as the left hand
      side of an assignment or as a subroutine argument for example).</dd>
  <dt>sv_upgrade from type %d down to type %d</dt>
  <dd>(P) Perl tried to force the upgrade of an SV to a type which was actually
      inferior to its current type.</dd>
  <dt>Switch (?(condition)... contains too many branches in regex; marked by

  <dd>(F) A (?(condition)if-clause|else-clause) construct can have at most two

    <pre>
    A keyword is misspelled.
    A semicolon is missing.
    A comma is missing.
    An opening or closing parenthesis is missing.

    <p class="Pp">Often there will be another error message associated with the
        syntax error giving more information. (Sometimes it helps to turn on
        <b>-w</b>.) The error message itself often tells you where it was in the
        line when it decided to give up. Sometimes the actual error is several
        tokens before this, because Perl is good at understanding random input.
        Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in a blue moon
        the only way to figure out what's triggering the error is to call
        <span class="Li">&quot;perl -c&quot;</span> repeatedly, chopping away
        half the program each time to see if the error went away. Sort of the
        cybernetic version of 20&#x00A0;questions.</p>

  <dt>syntax error in file %s at line %d, next 2 tokens &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(F) This error is likely to occur if you run a perl5 script through a

      before now. Check your control flow.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;-T&quot; and &quot;-B&quot; not implemented on filehandles</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl can't peek at the stdio buffer of filehandles when it doesn't
      know about your kind of stdio. You'll have to use a filename instead.</dd>
  <dt>Target of goto is too deeply nested</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to use <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span> to reach a
      label that was too deeply nested for Perl to reach. Perl is doing you a
      favor by refusing.</dd>
  <dt><i>telldir()</i> attempted on invalid dirhandle %s</dt>

  <dt>The <i>crypt()</i> function is unimplemented due to excessive
    paranoia.</dt>
  <dd>(F) Configure couldn't find the <i>crypt()</i> function on your machine,
      probably because your vendor didn't supply it, probably because they think
      the U.S. Government thinks it's a secret, or at least that they will
      continue to pretend that it is. And if you quote me on that, I will deny
      it.</dd>
  <dt>The lexical_subs feature is experimental</dt>
  <dd>(S experimental::lexical_subs) This warning is emitted if you declare a

      <span class="Li">&quot;state&quot;</span>. Simply suppress the warning if
      you want to use the feature, but know that in doing so you are taking the

      <span class="Li">&quot;(?[&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;])&quot;</span> in a
      regular expression. The details of this feature are subject to change. if
      you want to use it, but know that in doing so you are taking the risk of
      using an experimental feature which may change in a future Perl version,
      you can do this to silence the warning:

    <pre>
    no warnings &quot;experimental::regex_sets&quot;;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>The %s feature is experimental</dt>
  <dd>(S experimental) This warning is emitted if you enable an experimental
      feature via <span class="Li">&quot;use feature&quot;</span>. Simply
      suppress the warning if you want to use the feature, but know that in
      doing so you are taking the risk of using an experimental feature which
      may change or be removed in a future Perl version:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>

  <dt>The %s function is unimplemented</dt>
  <dd>(F) The function indicated isn't implemented on this architecture,
      according to the probings of Configure.</dd>
  <dt>The stat preceding %s wasn't an lstat</dt>
  <dd>(F) It makes no sense to test the current stat buffer for symbolic
      linkhood if the last stat that wrote to the stat buffer already went past
      the symlink to get to the real file. Use an actual filename instead.</dd>
  <dt>The 'unique' attribute may only be applied to 'our' variables</dt>
  <dd>(F) This attribute was never supported on

  <dt>This Perl can't reset CRTL environ elements (%s)</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>This Perl can't set CRTL environ elements (%s=%s)</dt>
  <dd>(W internal) Warnings peculiar to VMS. You tried to change or delete an
      element of the CRTL's internal environ array, but your copy of Perl wasn't
      built with a CRTL that contained the <i>setenv()</i> function. You'll need
      to rebuild Perl with a CRTL that does, or redefine <i>PERL_ENV_TABLES</i>
      (see perlvms) so that the environ array isn't the target of the change to
      <span class="Li">%ENV</span> which produced the warning.</dd>
  <dt>This Perl has not been built with support for randomized hash key
    traversal but something called <i>Perl_hv_rand_set()</i>.</dt>
  <dd>(F) Something has attempted to use an internal API call which depends on
      Perl being compiled with the default support for randomized hash key
      traversal, but this Perl has been compiled without it. You should report
      this warning to the relevant upstream party, or recompile perl with
      default options.</dd>
  <dt>thread failed to start: %s</dt>
  <dd>(W threads)(S) The entry point function of threads-&gt;<i>create()</i>
      failed for some reason.</dd>
  <dt>times not implemented</dt>
  <dd>(F) Your version of the C library apparently doesn't do <i>times()</i>. I
      suspect you're not running on Unix.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;-T&quot; is on the #! line, it must also be used on the command
    line</dt>
  <dd>(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains the
      <b>-T</b> option (or the <b>-t</b> option), but Perl was not invoked with
      <b>-T</b> in its command line. This is an error because, by the time Perl
      discovers a <b>-T</b> in a script, it's too late to properly taint
      everything from the environment. So Perl gives up.
    <p class="Pp">If the Perl script is being executed as a command using the #!
        mechanism (or its local equivalent), this error can usually be fixed by
        editing the #! line so that the <b>-%c</b> option is a part of Perl's
        first argument: e.g. change <span class="Li">&quot;perl -n
        -%c&quot;</span> to <span class="Li">&quot;perl -%c -n&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the Perl script is being executed as
        <span class="Li">&quot;perl scriptname&quot;</span>, then the <b>-%c</b>
        option must appear on the command line: <span class="Li">&quot;perl -%c
        scriptname&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>To%s: illegal mapping '%s'</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to define a customized To-mapping for <i>lc()</i>, lcfirst,
      <i>uc()</i>, or <i>ucfirst()</i> (or their string-inlined versions), but
      you specified an illegal mapping. See &quot;User-Defined Character
      Properties&quot; in perlunicode.</dd>
  <dt>Too deeply nested ()-groups</dt>
  <dd>(F) Your template contains ()-groups with a ridiculously deep nesting
      level.</dd>
  <dt>Too few args to syscall</dt>
  <dd>(F) There has to be at least one argument to <i>syscall()</i> to specify
      the system call to call, silly dilly.</dd>
  <dt>Too late for &quot;-%s&quot; option</dt>
  <dd>(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains the
      <b>-M</b>, <b>-m</b> or <b>-C</b> option.
    <p class="Pp">In the case of <b>-M</b> and <b>-m</b>, this is an error
        because those options are not intended for use inside scripts. Use the
        <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> pragma instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <b>-C</b> option only works if it is specified on the
        command line as well (with the same sequence of letters or numbers
        following). Either specify this option on the command line, or, if your
        system supports it, make your script executable and run it directly
        instead of passing it to perl.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Too late to run %s block</dt>
  <dd>(W void) A CHECK or INIT block is being defined during run time proper,
      when the opportunity to run them has already passed. Perhaps you are
      loading a file with <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span> when you should be using
      <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> instead. Or perhaps you should put
      the <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span> inside a BEGIN block.</dd>
  <dt>Too many args to syscall</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl supports a maximum of only 14 args to <i>syscall()</i>.</dd>
  <dt>Too many arguments for %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The function requires fewer arguments than you specified.</dd>
  <dt>Too many )'s</dt>

  <dt>Trailing \ in regex m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) The regular expression ends with an unbackslashed backslash. Backslash
      it. See perlre.</dd>
  <dt>Trailing white-space in a charnames alias definition is deprecated</dt>
  <dd>(D) You defined a character name which ended in a space character. Remove
      the trailing space(s). Usually these names are defined in the
      <span class="Li">&quot;:alias&quot;</span> import argument to
      <span class="Li">&quot;use charnames&quot;</span>, but they could be
      defined by a translator installed into

      charnames.</dd>
  <dt>Transliteration pattern not terminated</dt>
  <dd>(F) The lexer couldn't find the interior delimiter of a tr/// or tr[][] or
      y/// or y[][] construct. Missing the leading
      <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span> from variables
      <span class="Li">$tr</span> or <span class="Li">$y</span> may cause this
      error.</dd>

  <dd>(F) The lexer couldn't find the final delimiter of a tr///, tr[][], y///
      or y[][] construct.</dd>

  <dt>truncate not implemented</dt>
  <dd>(F) Your machine doesn't implement a file truncation mechanism that
      Configure knows about.</dd>
  <dt>Type of arg %d to &amp;CORE::%s must be %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The subroutine in question in the CORE package requires its argument
      to be a hard reference to data of the specified type. Overloading is
      ignored, so a reference to an object that is not the specified type, but
      nonetheless has overloading to handle it, will still not be accepted.</dd>
  <dt>Type of arg %d to %s must be %s (not %s)</dt>
  <dd>(F) This function requires the argument in that position to be of a
      certain type. Arrays must be <span class="Li">@NAME</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;@{EXPR}&quot;</span>. Hashes must be
      <span class="Li">%NAME</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;%{EXPR}&quot;</span>. No implicit dereferencing is
      allowed--use the {EXPR} forms as an explicit dereference. See
    perlref.</dd>
  <dt>Type of argument to %s must be unblessed hashref or arrayref</dt>
  <dd>(F) You called <span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;values&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span> with a scalar argument that was
      not a reference to an unblessed hash or array.</dd>
  <dt>umask not implemented</dt>
  <dd>(F) Your machine doesn't implement the umask function and you tried to use
      it to restrict permissions for yourself (EXPR &amp; 0700).</dd>

      (inclusive), are used by Unicode only for UTF-16. However, Perl internally
      allows all unsigned integer code points (up to the size limit available on

  <dt>Unknown PerlIO layer &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(W layer) An attempt was made to push an unknown layer onto the Perl I/O
      system. (Layers take care of transforming data between external and
      internal representations.) Note that some layers, such as
      <span class="Li">&quot;mmap&quot;</span>, are not supported in all
      environments. If your program didn't explicitly request the failing
      operation, it may be the result of the value of the environment variable
      PERLIO.</dd>
  <dt>Unknown process %x sent message to prime_env_iter: %s</dt>
  <dd>(P) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl was reading values for
      <span class="Li">%ENV</span> before iterating over it, and someone else
      stuck a message in the stream of data Perl expected. Someone's very
      confused, or perhaps trying to subvert Perl's population of
      <span class="Li">%ENV</span> for nefarious purposes.</dd>
  <dt>Unknown &quot;re&quot; subpragma '%s' (known ones are: %s)</dt>
  <dd>(W) You tried to use an unknown subpragma of the &quot;re&quot;
    pragma.</dd>
  <dt>Unknown regex modifier &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(F) Alphanumerics immediately following the closing delimiter of a regular
      expression pattern are interpreted by Perl as modifier flags for the
      regex. One of the ones you specified is invalid. One way this can happen
      is if you didn't put in white space between the end of the regex and a
      following alphanumeric operator:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 if ($a =~ /foo/and $bar == 3) { ... }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span> is a valid modifier
        flag, but the <span class="Li">&quot;n&quot;</span> is not, and raises
        this error. Likely what was meant instead was:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 if ($a =~ /foo/ and $bar == 3) { ... }
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Unknown switch condition (?(%s in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in

  <dd>(F) The condition part of a (?(condition)if-clause|else-clause) construct

    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 (1) (2) ...        true if 1st, 2nd, etc., capture matched
 (&lt;NAME&gt;) ('NAME')  true if named capture matched
 (?=...) (?&lt;=...)   true if subpattern matches
 (?!...) (?&lt;!...)   true if subpattern fails to match
 (?{ CODE })        true if code returns a true value
 (R)                true if evaluating inside recursion
 (R1) (R2) ...      true if directly inside capture group 1, 2, etc.

      your pattern. Check the pattern and review perlre for details on legal
      verb patterns.</dd>
  <dt>Unknown warnings category '%s'</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error issued by the <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span>
      pragma. You specified a warnings category that is unknown to perl at this
      point.
    <p class="Pp">Note that if you want to enable a warnings category registered
        by a module (e.g. <span class="Li">&quot;use warnings
        'File::Find'&quot;</span>), you must have loaded this module first.</p>

  <dt>Unmatched [ in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) The brackets around a character class must match. If you wish to

  <dd></dd>
  <dt>Unmatched ) in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) Unbackslashed parentheses must always be balanced in regular
      expressions. If you're a vi user, the % key is valuable for finding the
      matching parenthesis. The &lt;-- HERE shows whereabouts in the regular
      expression the problem was discovered. See perlre.</dd>
  <dt>Unmatched right %s bracket</dt>
  <dd>(F) The lexer counted more closing curly or square brackets than opening
      ones, so you're probably missing a matching opening bracket. As a general
      rule, you'll find the missing one (so to speak) near the place you were
      last editing.</dd>
  <dt>Unquoted string &quot;%s&quot; may clash with future reserved word</dt>
  <dd>(W reserved) You used a bareword that might someday be claimed as a
      reserved word. It's best to put such a word in quotes, or capitalize it
      somehow, or insert an underbar into it. You might also declare it as a
      subroutine.</dd>
  <dt>Unrecognized character %s; marked by &lt;-- HERE after %s near column
    %d</dt>
  <dd>(F) The Perl parser has no idea what to do with the specified character in
      your Perl script (or eval) near the specified column. Perhaps you tried to
      run a compressed script, a binary program, or a directory as a Perl
      program.</dd>
  <dt>Unrecognized escape \%c in character class in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE
    in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used a backslash-character combination which is not recognized by
      Perl inside character classes. This is a fatal error when the character
      class is used within <span class="Li">&quot;(?[ ])&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Unrecognized escape \%c in character class passed through in regex; marked
    by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(W regexp) You used a backslash-character combination which is not
      recognized by Perl inside character classes. The character was understood
      literally, but this may change in a future version of Perl. The &lt;--
      HERE shows whereabouts in the regular expression the escape was
      discovered.</dd>
  <dt>Unrecognized escape \%c passed through</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You used a backslash-character combination which is not
      recognized by Perl. The character was understood literally, but this may
      change in a future version of Perl.</dd>
  <dt>Unrecognized escape \%s passed through in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in
    m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(W regexp) You used a backslash-character combination which is not
      recognized by Perl. The character(s) were understood literally, but this
      may change in a future version of Perl. The &lt;-- HERE shows whereabouts
      in the regular expression the escape was discovered.</dd>
  <dt>Unrecognized signal name &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(F) You specified a signal name to the <i>kill()</i> function that was not
      recognized. Say <span class="Li">&quot;kill -l&quot;</span> in your shell
      to see the valid signal names on your system.</dd>
  <dt>Unrecognized switch: -%s (-h will show valid options)</dt>
  <dd>(F) You specified an illegal option to Perl. Don't do that. (If you think
      you didn't do that, check the #! line to see if it's supplying the bad
      switch on your behalf.)</dd>
  <dt>Unsuccessful %s on filename containing newline</dt>
  <dd>(W newline) A file operation was attempted on a filename, and that
      operation failed, PROBABLY because the filename contained a newline,
      PROBABLY because you forgot to <i>chomp()</i> it off. See
      &quot;chomp&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Unsupported directory function &quot;%s&quot; called</dt>
  <dd>(F) Your machine doesn't support <i>opendir()</i> and
    <i>readdir()</i>.</dd>
  <dt>Unsupported function %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) This machine doesn't implement the indicated function, apparently. At
      least, Configure doesn't think so.</dd>
  <dt>Unsupported function fork</dt>
  <dd>(F) Your version of executable does not support forking.
    <p class="Pp">Note that under some systems, like OS/2, there may be
        different flavors of Perl executables, some of which may support fork,
        some not. Try changing the name you call Perl by to
        <span class="Li">&quot;perl_&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;perl__&quot;</span>, and so on.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Unsupported script encoding %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) Your program file begins with a Unicode Byte Order Mark (BOM) which
      declares it to be in a Unicode encoding that Perl cannot read.</dd>
  <dt>Unsupported socket function &quot;%s&quot; called</dt>
  <dd>(F) Your machine doesn't support the Berkeley socket mechanism, or at
      least that's what Configure thought.</dd>
  <dt>Unterminated attribute list</dt>
  <dd>(F) The lexer found something other than a simple identifier at the start
      of an attribute, and it wasn't a semicolon or the start of a block.
      Perhaps you terminated the parameter list of the previous attribute too
      soon. See attributes.</dd>
  <dt>Unterminated attribute parameter in attribute list</dt>
  <dd>(F) The lexer saw an opening (left) parenthesis character while parsing an
      attribute list, but the matching closing (right) parenthesis character was
      not found. You may need to add (or remove) a backslash character to get
      your parentheses to balance. See attributes.</dd>
  <dt>Unterminated compressed integer</dt>
  <dd>(F) An argument to unpack(&quot;w&quot;,...) was incompatible with the BER
      compressed integer format and could not be converted to an integer. See
      &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Unterminated delimiter for here document</dt>
  <dd>(F) This message occurs when a here document label has an initial
      quotation mark but the final quotation mark is missing. Perhaps you wrote:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    &lt;&lt;&quot;foo
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">instead of:</p>

    <pre>
    &lt;&lt;&quot;foo&quot;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Unterminated \g{...} pattern in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) You missed a close brace on a \g{..} pattern (group reference) in a
      regular expression. Fix the pattern and retry.</dd>
  <dt>Unterminated &lt;&gt; operator</dt>
  <dd>(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting a
      term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and not
      finding it. Chances are you left some needed parentheses out earlier in
      the line, and you really meant a &quot;less than&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>Unterminated verb pattern argument in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in
    m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used a pattern of the form
      <span class="Li">&quot;(*VERB:ARG)&quot;</span> but did not terminate the
      pattern with a <span class="Li">&quot;)&quot;</span>. Fix the pattern and
      retry.</dd>
  <dt>Unterminated verb pattern in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used a pattern of the form
      <span class="Li">&quot;(*VERB)&quot;</span> but did not terminate the
      pattern with a <span class="Li">&quot;)&quot;</span>. Fix the pattern and
      retry.</dd>
  <dt>untie attempted while %d inner references still exist</dt>
  <dd>(W untie) A copy of the object returned from
      <span class="Li">&quot;tie&quot;</span> (or
      <span class="Li">&quot;tied&quot;</span>) was still valid when
      <span class="Li">&quot;untie&quot;</span> was called.</dd>
  <dt>Usage: POSIX::%s(%s)</dt>
  <dd>(F) You called a POSIX function with incorrect arguments. See
      &quot;FUNCTIONS&quot; in POSIX for more information.</dd>

  <dd>(F) You called a Win32 function with incorrect arguments. See Win32 for
      more information.</dd>
  <dt>$[ used in %s (did you mean $] ?)</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) You used <span class="Li">$[</span> in a comparison, such as:

        ...
    }

    <p class="Pp">You probably meant to use <span class="Li">$]</span> instead.
        <span class="Li">$[</span> is the base for indexing arrays.
        <span class="Li">$]</span> is the Perl version number in decimal.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Use \\x{...} for more than two hex characters in regex; marked by &lt;--

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Perl isn't sure if you meant this</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 (?[ [ \x{BE} E F ] ])
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You need to add either braces or blanks to disambiguate.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Use of <i>each()</i> on hash after insertion without resetting hash
    iterator results in undefined behavior</dt>
  <dd>(S internal) The behavior of <span class="Li">&quot;each()&quot;</span>
      after insertion is undefined, it may skip items, or visit items more than
      once. Consider using <span class="Li">&quot;keys()&quot;</span> instead of
      <span class="Li">&quot;each()&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Useless assignment to a temporary</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You assigned to an lvalue subroutine, but what the subroutine
      returned was a temporary scalar about to be discarded, so the assignment
      had no effect.</dd>
  <dt>Useless (?-%s) - don't use /%s modifier in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in
    m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(W regexp) You have used an internal modifier such as (?-o) that has no
      meaning unless removed from the entire regexp:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    if ($string =~ /(?-o)$pattern/o) { ... }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">must be written as</p>

    <p class="Pp">The &lt;-- HERE shows whereabouts in the regular expression
        the problem was discovered. See perlre.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Useless localization of %s</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) The localization of lvalues such as
      <span class="Li">&quot;local($x=10)&quot;</span> is legal, but in fact the
      <i>local()</i> currently has no effect. This may change at some point in
      the future, but in the meantime such code is discouraged.</dd>
  <dt>Useless (?%s) - use /%s modifier in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in
    m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(W regexp) You have used an internal modifier such as (?o) that has no
      meaning unless applied to the entire regexp:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    if ($string =~ /(?o)$pattern/) { ... }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">must be written as</p>

  <dt>Useless use of /d modifier in transliteration operator</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You have used the /d modifier where the searchlist has the same
      length as the replacelist. See perlop for more information about the /d
      modifier.</dd>
  <dt>Useless use of '\'; doesn't escape metacharacter '%c'</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) You wrote a regular expression pattern something like one
      of these:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 m{ \x\{FF\} }x
 m{foo\{1,3\}}
 qr(foo\(bar\))
 s[foo\[a-z\]bar][baz]
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The interior braces, square brackets, and parentheses are
        treated as metacharacters even though they are backslashed; instead
        write:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
 m{ \x{FF} }x
 m{foo{1,3}}
 qr(foo(bar))
 s[foo[a-z]bar][baz]
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The backslashes have no effect when a regular expression
        pattern is delimitted by <span class="Li">&quot;{}&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;[]&quot;</span>, or
        <span class="Li">&quot;()&quot;</span>, which ordinarily are
        metacharacters, and the delimiters are also used, paired, within the
        interior of the pattern. It is planned that a future Perl release will
        change the meaning of constructs like these so that the backslashes will
        have an effect, so remove them from your code.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Useless use of \E</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You have a \E in a double-quotish string without a
      <span class="Li">&quot;\U&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;\L&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;\Q&quot;</span> preceding it.</dd>
  <dt>Useless use of %s in void context</dt>
  <dd>(W void) You did something without a side effect in a context that does
      nothing with the return value, such as a statement that doesn't return a
      value from a block, or the left side of a scalar comma operator. Very
      often this points not to stupidity on your part, but a failure of Perl to
      parse your program the way you thought it would. For example, you'd get
      this if you mixed up your C precedence with Python precedence and said
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $one, $two = 1, 2;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">when you meant to say</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    ($one, $two) = (1, 2);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Another common error is to use ordinary parentheses to
        construct a list reference when you should be using square or curly
        brackets, for example, if you say</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $array = (1,2);

    <p class="Pp">when you should have said</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $array = [1,2];
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The square brackets explicitly turn a list value into a scalar
        value, while parentheses do not. So when a parenthesized list is
        evaluated in a scalar context, the comma is treated like C's comma
        operator, which throws away the left argument, which is not what you
        want. See perlref for more on this.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This warning will not be issued for numerical constants equal

  <dt>Useless use of (?-p) in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(W regexp) The <span class="Li">&quot;p&quot;</span> modifier cannot be
      turned off once set. Trying to do so is futile.</dd>
  <dt>Useless use of %s with no values</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) You used the <i>push()</i> or <i>unshift()</i> function with no
      arguments apart from the array, like
      <span class="Li">&quot;push(@x)&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;unshift(@foo)&quot;</span>. That won't usually have
      any effect on the array, so is completely useless. It's possible in
      principle that push(@tied_array) could have some effect if the array is
      tied to a class which implements a PUSH method. If so, you can write it as
      <span class="Li">&quot;push(@tied_array,())&quot;</span> to avoid this

      without the <span class="Li">&quot;/g&quot;</span> modifier being
      specified as well; hence things like
      <span class="Li">&quot;(?c)&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;(?-c:)&quot;</span> do nothing, nor do thing like
      <span class="Li">&quot;(?gc)&quot;</span> nor

  <dt>&quot;use&quot; not allowed in expression</dt>
  <dd>(F) The &quot;use&quot; keyword is recognized and executed at compile
      time, and returns no useful value. See perlmod.</dd>
  <dt>Use of assignment to $[ is deprecated</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) The <span class="Li">$[</span> variable (index of the first
      element in an array) is deprecated. See &quot;$[&quot; in perlvar.</dd>
  <dt>Use of bare &lt;&lt; to mean &lt;&lt;&quot;&quot; is deprecated</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) You are now encouraged to use the explicitly quoted form if
      you wish to use an empty line as the terminator of the here-document.</dd>
  <dt>Use of comma-less variable list is deprecated</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) The values you give to a format should be separated by
      commas, not just aligned on a line.</dd>
  <dt>Use of chdir('') or chdir(undef) as <i>chdir()</i> deprecated</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) <i>chdir()</i> with no arguments is documented to change to
      <span class="Li">$ENV</span>{HOME} or
      <span class="Li">$ENV</span>{LOGDIR}. chdir(undef) and chdir('') share
      this behavior, but that has been deprecated. In future versions they will
      simply fail.
    <p class="Pp">Be careful to check that what you pass to <i>chdir()</i> is
        defined and not blank, else you might find yourself in your home
        directory.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Use of /c modifier is meaningless in s///</dt>
  <dd>(W regexp) You used the /c modifier in a substitution. The /c modifier is
      not presently meaningful in substitutions.</dd>
  <dt>Use of /c modifier is meaningless without /g</dt>
  <dd>(W regexp) You used the /c modifier with a regex operand, but didn't use
      the /g modifier. Currently, /c is meaningful only when /g is used. (This
      may change in the future.)</dd>
  <dt>Use of := for an empty attribute list is not allowed</dt>
  <dd>(F) The construction <span class="Li">&quot;my $x := 42&quot;</span> used
      to parse as equivalent to <span class="Li">&quot;my $x : = 42&quot;</span>
      (applying an empty attribute list to <span class="Li">$x</span>). This
      construct was deprecated in 5.12.0, and has now been made a syntax error,
      so <span class="Li">&quot;:=&quot;</span> can be reclaimed as a new
      operator in the future.
    <p class="Pp">If you need an empty attribute list, for example in a code
        generator, add a space before the
      <span class="Li">&quot;=&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Use of freed value in iteration</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perhaps you modified the iterated array within the loop? This error is
      typically caused by code like the following:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    @a = (3,4);
    @a = () for (1,2,@a);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You are not supposed to modify arrays while they are being
        iterated over. For speed and efficiency reasons, Perl internally does
        not do full reference-counting of iterated items, hence deleting such an
        item in the middle of an iteration causes Perl to see a freed value.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Use of *glob{FILEHANDLE} is deprecated</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) You are now encouraged to use the shorter *glob{IO} form to
      access the filehandle slot within a typeglob.</dd>
  <dt>Use of /g modifier is meaningless in split</dt>
  <dd>(W regexp) You used the /g modifier on the pattern for a
      <span class="Li">&quot;split&quot;</span> operator. Since
      <span class="Li">&quot;split&quot;</span> always tries to match the
      pattern repeatedly, the <span class="Li">&quot;/g&quot;</span> has no
      effect.</dd>
  <dt>Use of &quot;goto&quot; to jump into a construct is deprecated</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) Using <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span> to jump from
      an outer scope into an inner scope is deprecated and should be
    avoided.</dd>
  <dt>Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method %s() is deprecated</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) As an (ahem) accidental feature,
      <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span> subroutines are looked up as
      methods (using the <span class="Li">@ISA</span> hierarchy) even when the
      subroutines to be autoloaded were called as plain functions (e.g.
      <span class="Li">&quot;Foo::bar()&quot;</span>), not as methods (e.g.
      <span class="Li">&quot;Foo-&gt;bar()&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;$obj-&gt;bar()&quot;</span>).
    <p class="Pp">This bug will be rectified in future by using method lookup
        only for methods' <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span>s.
        However, there is a significant base of existing code that may be using
        the old behavior. So, as an interim step, Perl currently issues an
        optional warning when non-methods use inherited
        <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span>s.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The simple rule is: Inheritance will not work when autoloading
        non-methods. The simple fix for old code is: In any module that used to
        depend on inheriting <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span> for
        non-methods from a base class named
        <span class="Li">&quot;BaseClass&quot;</span>, execute
        <span class="Li">&quot;*AUTOLOAD =
        \&amp;BaseClass::AUTOLOAD&quot;</span> during startup.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In code that currently says <span class="Li">&quot;use
        AutoLoader; @ISA = qw(AutoLoader);&quot;</span> you should remove
        AutoLoader from <span class="Li">@ISA</span> and change
        <span class="Li">&quot;use AutoLoader;&quot;</span> to
        <span class="Li">&quot;use AutoLoader 'AUTOLOAD';&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Use of %s in printf format not supported</dt>
  <dd>(F) You attempted to use a feature of printf that is accessible from only
      C. This usually means there's a better way to do it in Perl.</dd>
  <dt>Use of %s is deprecated</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) The construct indicated is no longer recommended for use,
      generally because there's a better way to do it, and also because the old
      way has bad side effects.</dd>
  <dt>Use of -l on filehandle %s</dt>
  <dd>(W io) A filehandle represents an opened file, and when you opened the
      file it already went past any symlink you are presumably trying to look
      for. The operation returned <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>. Use
      a filename instead.</dd>
  <dt>Use of my $_ is experimental</dt>
  <dd>(S experimental::lexical_topic) Lexical <span class="Li">$_</span> is an
      experimental feature and its behavior may change or even be removed in any
      future release of perl. See the explanation under &quot;$_&quot; in
      perlvar.</dd>
  <dt>Use of %s on a handle without * is deprecated</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) You used <span class="Li">&quot;tie&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;tied&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;untie&quot;</span> on a scalar but that scalar
      happens to hold a typeglob, which means its filehandle will be tied. If
      you mean to tie a handle, use an explicit * as in
      <span class="Li">&quot;tie *$handle&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">This was a long-standing bug that was removed in Perl 5.16, as
        there was no way to tie the scalar itself when it held a typeglob, and
        no way to untie a scalar that had had a typeglob assigned to it. If you
        see this message, you must be using an older version.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Use of ?PATTERN? without explicit operator is deprecated</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) You have written something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;?\w?&quot;</span>, for a regular expression that
      matches only once. Starting this term directly with the question mark
      delimiter is now deprecated, so that the question mark will be available
      for use in new operators in the future. Write
      <span class="Li">&quot;m?\w?&quot;</span> instead, explicitly using the
      <span class="Li">&quot;m&quot;</span> operator: the question mark
      delimiter still invokes match-once behaviour.</dd>
  <dt>Use of reference &quot;%s&quot; as array index</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) You tried to use a reference as an array index; this probably
      isn't what you mean, because references in numerical context tend to be
      huge numbers, and so usually indicates programmer error.
    <p class="Pp">If you really do mean it, explicitly numify your reference,
        like so: <span class="Li">$array[0+$ref]</span>. This warning is not
        given for overloaded objects, however, because you can overload the
        numification and stringification operators and then you presumably know
        what you are doing.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Use of state $_ is experimental</dt>
  <dd>(S experimental::lexical_topic) Lexical <span class="Li">$_</span> is an
      experimental feature and its behavior may change or even be removed in any
      future release of perl. See the explanation under &quot;$_&quot; in
      perlvar.</dd>
  <dt>Use of tainted arguments in %s is deprecated</dt>
  <dd>(W taint, deprecated) You have supplied
      <span class="Li">&quot;system()&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;exec()&quot;</span> with multiple arguments and at
      least one of them is tainted. This used to be allowed but will become a
      fatal error in a future version of perl. Untaint your arguments. See
      perlsec.</dd>
  <dt>Use of uninitialized value%s</dt>
  <dd>(W uninitialized) An undefined value was used as if it were already
      defined. It was interpreted as a &quot;&quot; or a 0, but maybe it was a
      mistake. To suppress this warning assign a defined value to your
      variables.
    <p class="Pp">To help you figure out what was undefined, perl will try to
        tell you the name of the variable (if any) that was undefined. In some
        cases it cannot do this, so it also tells you what operation you used
        the undefined value in. Note, however, that perl optimizes your program
        anid the operation displayed in the warning may not necessarily appear
        literally in your program. For example, <span class="Li">&quot;that
        $foo&quot;</span> is usually optimized into
        <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;that &quot; . $foo&quot;</span>, and the
        warning will refer to the <span class="Li">&quot;concatenation
        (.)&quot;</span> operator, even though there is no
        <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> in your program.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Using a hash as a reference is deprecated</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) You tried to use a hash as a reference, as in
      <span class="Li">&quot;%foo-&gt;{&quot;bar&quot;}&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;%$ref-&gt;{&quot;hello&quot;}&quot;</span>.
      Versions of perl &lt;= 5.6.1 used to allow this syntax, but shouldn't
      have. It is now deprecated, and will be removed in a future version.</dd>
  <dt>Using an array as a reference is deprecated</dt>
  <dd>(D deprecated) You tried to use an array as a reference, as in
      <span class="Li">&quot;@foo-&gt;[23]&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;@$ref-&gt;[99]&quot;</span>. Versions of perl &lt;=
      5.6.1 used to allow this syntax, but shouldn't have. It is now deprecated,

  <dt>Using just the first character returned by \N{} in character class in
    regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(W regexp) A charnames handler may return a sequence of more than one
      character. Currently all but the first one are discarded when used in a
      regular expression pattern bracketed character class.</dd>
  <dt>Using !~ with %s doesn't make sense</dt>
  <dd>(F) Using the <span class="Li">&quot;!~&quot;</span> operator with

      <span class="Li">&quot;tr///r&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;y///r&quot;</span> is currently reserved for future
      use, as the exact behaviour has not been decided. (Simply returning the
      boolean opposite of the modified string is usually not particularly
      useful.)</dd>
  <dt>UTF-16 surrogate U+%X</dt>
  <dd>(S utf8, surrogate) You had a UTF-16 surrogate in a context where they are
      not considered acceptable. These code points, between U+D800 and U+DFFF
      (inclusive), are used by Unicode only for UTF-16. However, Perl internally
      allows all unsigned integer code points (up to the size limit available on
      your platform), including surrogates. But these can cause problems when
      being input or output, which is likely where this message came from. If
      you really really know what you are doing you can turn off this warning by
      <span class="Li">&quot;no warnings 'surrogate';&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Value of %s can be &quot;0&quot;; test with <i>defined()</i></dt>
  <dd>(W misc) In a conditional expression, you used &lt;HANDLE&gt;, &lt;*&gt;
      (glob), <span class="Li">&quot;each()&quot;</span>, or
      <span class="Li">&quot;readdir()&quot;</span> as a boolean value. Each of
      these constructs can return a value of &quot;0&quot;; that would make the
      conditional expression false, which is probably not what you intended.
      When using these constructs in conditional expressions, test their values
      with the <span class="Li">&quot;defined&quot;</span> operator.</dd>
  <dt>Value of CLI symbol &quot;%s&quot; too long</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) A warning peculiar to VMS. Perl tried to read the value of an
      <span class="Li">%ENV</span> element from a CLI symbol table, and found a
      resultant string longer than 1024 characters. The return value has been
      truncated to 1024 characters.</dd>
  <dt>Variable &quot;%s&quot; is not available</dt>
  <dd>(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is
      attempting to capture an outer lexical that is not currently available.
      This can happen for one of two reasons. First, the outer lexical may be
      declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not yet been created.
      (Remember that named subs are created at compile time, while anonymous
      subs are created at run-time.) For example,
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub { my $a; sub f { $a } }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current
        value of <span class="Li">$a</span>, since the anonymous subroutine
        hasn't been created yet. Conversely, the following won't give a warning
        since the anonymous subroutine has by now been created and is live:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub { my $a; eval 'sub f { $a }' }-&gt;();
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a variable
        that has gone out of scope, for example,</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub f {
        my $a;
        sub { eval '$a' }
    }
    f()-&gt;();
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Here, when the '$a' in the eval is being compiled, f() is not
        currently being executed, so its <span class="Li">$a</span> is not
        available for capture.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Variable &quot;%s&quot; is not imported%s</dt>
  <dd>(S misc) With &quot;use strict&quot; in effect, you referred to a global
      variable that you apparently thought was imported from another module,
      because something else of the same name (usually a subroutine) is exported
      by that module. It usually means you put the wrong funny character on the
      front of your variable.</dd>
  <dt>Variable length lookbehind not implemented in regex m/%s/</dt>
  <dd>(F) Lookbehind is allowed only for subexpressions whose length is fixed
      and known at compile time. See perlre.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;%s&quot; variable %s masks earlier declaration in same %s</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) A &quot;my&quot;, &quot;our&quot; or &quot;state&quot; variable
      has been redeclared in the current scope or statement, effectively
      eliminating all access to the previous instance. This is almost always a
      typographical error. Note that the earlier variable will still exist until
      the end of the scope or until all closure references to it are
    destroyed.</dd>
  <dt>Variable syntax</dt>
  <dd>(A) You've accidentally run your script through <b>csh</b> instead of
      Perl. Check the #! line, or manually feed your script into Perl
    yourself.</dd>
  <dt>Variable &quot;%s&quot; will not stay shared</dt>
  <dd>(W closure) An inner (nested) <i>named</i> subroutine is referencing a
      lexical variable defined in an outer named subroutine.
    <p class="Pp">When the inner subroutine is called, it will see the value of
        the outer subroutine's variable as it was before and during the *first*
        call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first call to the
        outer subroutine is complete, the inner and outer subroutines will no
        longer share a common value for the variable. In other words, the
        variable will no longer be shared.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This problem can usually be solved by making the inner
        subroutine anonymous, using the <span class="Li">&quot;sub
        {}&quot;</span> syntax. When inner anonymous subs that reference
        variables in outer subroutines are created, they are automatically
        rebound to the current values of such variables.</p>

  <dt>Version number must be a constant number</dt>
  <dd>(P) The attempt to translate a <span class="Li">&quot;use Module n.n

      inconsistency with the version number.</dd>
  <dt>Version string '%s' contains invalid data; ignoring: '%s'</dt>
  <dd>(W misc) The version string contains invalid characters at the end, which
      are being ignored.</dd>
  <dt>Warning: something's wrong</dt>
  <dd>(W) You passed <i>warn()</i> an empty string (the equivalent of
      <span class="Li">&quot;warn &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>) or you called it
      with no args and <span class="Li">$@</span> was empty.</dd>
  <dt>Warning: unable to close filehandle %s properly</dt>
  <dd>(S) The implicit <i>close()</i> done by an <i>open()</i> got an error
      indication on the <i>close()</i>. This usually indicates your file system
      ran out of disk space.</dd>
  <dt>Warning: Use of &quot;%s&quot; without parentheses is ambiguous</dt>
  <dd>(S ambiguous) You wrote a unary operator followed by something that looks
      like a binary operator that could also have been interpreted as a term or
      unary operator. For instance, if you know that the rand function has a
      default argument of 1.0, and you write
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    rand + 5;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">you may THINK you wrote the same thing as</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    rand() + 5;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">but in actual fact, you got</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    rand(+5);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">So put in parentheses to say what you really mean.</p>

  <dd>(S experimental::smartmatch) <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span>
      depends on smartmatch, which is experimental. Additionally, it has several

  <dt>Wide character in %s</dt>
  <dd>(S utf8) Perl met a wide character (&gt;255) when it wasn't expecting one.
      This warning is by default on for I/O (like print). The easiest way to
      quiet this warning is simply to add the
      <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span> layer to the output, e.g.
      <span class="Li">&quot;binmode STDOUT, ':utf8'&quot;</span>. Another way
      to turn off the warning is to add <span class="Li">&quot;no warnings
      'utf8';&quot;</span> but that is often closer to cheating. In general, you
      are supposed to explicitly mark the filehandle with an encoding, see open
      and &quot;binmode&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>Within []-length '%c' not allowed</dt>
  <dd>(F) The count in the (un)pack template may be replaced by
      <span class="Li">&quot;[TEMPLATE]&quot;</span> only if
      <span class="Li">&quot;TEMPLATE&quot;</span> always matches the same
      amount of packed bytes that can be determined from the template alone.
      This is not possible if it contains any of the codes @, /, U, u, w or a
      *-length. Redesign the template.</dd>
  <dt><i>write()</i> on closed filehandle %s</dt>
  <dd>(W closed) The filehandle you're writing to got itself closed sometime
      before now. Check your control flow.</dd>
  <dt>%s &quot;\x%X&quot; does not map to Unicode</dt>
  <dd>(F) When reading in different encodings, Perl tries to map everything into
      Unicode characters. The bytes you read in are not legal in this encoding.
      For example
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    utf8 &quot;\xE4&quot; does not map to Unicode
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">if you try to read in the a-diaereses Latin-1 as UTF-8.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>'X' outside of string</dt>
  <dd>(F) You had a (un)pack template that specified a relative position before
      the beginning of the string being (un)packed. See &quot;pack&quot; in
      perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>'x' outside of string in unpack</dt>
  <dd>(F) You had a pack template that specified a relative position after the
      end of the string being unpacked. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>YOU HAVEN'T DISABLED SET-ID SCRIPTS IN THE KERNEL YET!</dt>
  <dd>(F) And you probably never will, because you probably don't have the
      sources to your kernel, and your vendor probably doesn't give a rip about
      what you want. Your best bet is to put a setuid C wrapper around your
      script.</dd>
  <dt>You need to quote &quot;%s&quot;</dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) You assigned a bareword as a signal handler name.
      Unfortunately, you already have a subroutine of that name declared, which
      means that Perl 5 will try to call the subroutine when the assignment is
      executed, which is probably not what you want. (If it IS what you want,
