   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

The <b>perlivp</b> program is set up at Perl source code build time to test the
  Perl version it was built under. It can be used after running:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    make install
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(or your platform's equivalent procedure) to verify that
    <b>perl</b> and its libraries have been installed correctly. A correct
    installation is verified by output that looks like:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    ok 1
    ok 2
</pre>
<p class="Pp">etc.</p>

  <li>print &quot;# Perl binary '$perlpath' does not appear executable.\n&quot;;
    <p class="Pp">Likely to occur for a perl binary that was not properly
        installed. Correct by conducting a proper installation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>print &quot;# Perl version '$]' installed, expected
      <span class="Li">$ivp_VERSION</span>.\n&quot;;
    <p class="Pp">Likely to occur for a perl that was not properly installed.
        Correct by conducting a proper installation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>print &quot;# Perl \@INC directory '$_' does not appear to exist.\n&quot;;
    <p class="Pp">Likely to occur for a perl library tree that was not properly
        installed. Correct by conducting a proper installation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>print &quot;# Needed module '$_' does not appear to be properly
      installed.\n&quot;;
    <p class="Pp">One of the two modules that is used by perlivp was not present
        in the installation. This is a serious error since it adversely affects
        perlivp's ability to function. You may be able to correct this by
        performing a proper perl installation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>print &quot;# Required module '$_' does not appear to be properly
      installed.\n&quot;;
    <p class="Pp">An attempt to <span class="Li">&quot;eval &quot;require
        $module&quot;&quot;</span> failed, even though the list of extensions
        indicated that it should succeed. Correct by conducting a proper
        installation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>print &quot;# Unnecessary module 'bLuRfle' appears to be
      installed.\n&quot;;
    <p class="Pp">This test not coming out ok could indicate that you have in
        fact installed a bLuRfle.pm module or that the
        <span class="Li">&quot;eval &quot; require
        \&quot;$module_name.pm\&quot;; &quot;&quot;</span> test may give
        misleading results with your installation of perl. If yours is the
        latter case then please let the author know.</p>
  </li>
  <li>print &quot;# file&quot;,+($#missing == 0) ? '' : 's',&quot; missing from
      installation:\n&quot;;
    <p class="Pp">One or more files turned up missing according to a run of
        <span class="Li">&quot;ExtUtils::Installed -&gt; validate()&quot;</span>
        over your installation. Correct by conducting a proper installation.</p>
  </li>

<p class="Pp">For further information on how to conduct a proper installation
    consult the INSTALL file that comes with the perl source and the README file
    for your platform.</p>
