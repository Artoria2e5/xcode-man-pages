<b>pcap_get_selectable_fd()</b> returns, on UNIX, a file descriptor number for a
  file descriptor on which one can do a <b>select()</b>, <b>poll()</b>, or other
  such call to wait for it to be possible to read packets without blocking, if
  such a descriptor exists, or -1, if no such descriptor exists. Some network
  devices opened with <b>pcap_create()</b> and <b>pcap_activate()</b>, or with
  <b>pcap_open_live()</b>, do not support <b>select()</b> or <b>poll()</b> (for
  example, regular network devices on FreeBSD 4.3 and 4.4, and Endace DAG
  devices), so -1 is returned for those devices.
<p class="Pp">Note that a descriptor on which a read can be done without
    blocking may, on some platforms, not have any packets to read if the read
    timeout has expired. A call to <b>pcap_dispatch()</b> will return 0 in this
    case, but will not block.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that in:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>FreeBSD prior to FreeBSD 4.6;</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>NetBSD prior to NetBSD 3.0;</dd>

</dl>
<p class="Pp"><b>select()</b> and <b>poll()</b> do not work correctly on BPF
    devices; <b>pcap_get_selectable_fd()</b> will return a file descriptor on
    most of those versions (the exceptions being FreeBSD 4.3 and 4.4), but a
    simple <b>select()</b> or <b>poll()</b> will not indicate that the
    descriptor is readable until a full buffer's worth of packets is received,
    even if the read timeout expires before then. To work around this, an
    application that uses <b>select()</b> or <b>poll()</b> to wait for packets
    to arrive must put the <b>pcap_t</b> in non-blocking mode, and must arrange
    that the <b>select()</b> or <b>poll()</b> have a timeout less than or equal
    to the read timeout, and must try to read packets after that timeout
    expires, regardless of whether <b>select()</b> or <b>poll()</b> indicated
    that the file descriptor for the <b>pcap_t</b> is ready to be read or not.
    (That workaround will not work in FreeBSD 4.3 and later; however, in FreeBSD
    4.6 and later, <b>select()</b> and <b>poll()</b> work correctly on BPF
    devices, so the workaround isn't necessary, although it does no harm.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Note also that <b>poll()</b> doesn't work on character special
    files, including BPF devices, in Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5, so, while
    <b>select()</b> can be used on the descriptor returned by
    <b>pcap_get_selectable_fd()</b>, <b>poll()</b> cannot be used on it those
    versions of Mac OS X. Kqueues also don't work on that descriptor.
    <b>poll()</b>, but not kqueues, work on that descriptor in Mac OS X releases
    prior to 10.4; <b>poll()</b> and kqueues work on that descriptor in Mac OS X
    10.6 and later.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_get_selectable_fd()</b> is not available on Windows.</p>

A selectable file descriptor is returned if one exists; otherwise, -1 is
