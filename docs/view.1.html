<b>Vim</b> is a text editor that is upwards compatible to Vi. It can be used to
  edit all kinds of plain text. It is especially useful for editing programs.
<p class="Pp">There are a lot of enhancements above Vi: multi level undo, multi
    windows and buffers, syntax highlighting, command line editing, filename
    completion, on-line help, visual selection, etc.. See &quot;:help
    vi_diff.txt&quot; for a summary of the differences between <b>Vim</b> and
    Vi.</p>
<p class="Pp">While running <b>Vim</b> a lot of help can be obtained from the
    on-line help system, with the &quot;:help&quot; command. See the ON-LINE
    HELP section below.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most often <b>Vim</b> is started to edit a single file with the
    command</p>
<p class="Pp">	vim file</p>
<p class="Pp">More generally <b>Vim</b> is started with:</p>
<p class="Pp">	vim [options] [filelist]</p>
<p class="Pp">If the filelist is missing, the editor will start with an empty
    buffer. Otherwise exactly one out of the following four may be used to
    choose one or more files to be edited.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>file ..</dt>
  <dd>A list of filenames. The first one will be the current file and read into
      the buffer. The cursor will be positioned on the first line of the buffer.
      You can get to the other files with the &quot;:next&quot; command. To edit
      a file that starts with a dash, precede the filelist with
    &quot;--&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>-</dt>
  <dd>The file to edit is read from stdin. Commands are read from stderr, which
      should be a tty.</dd>
  <dt>-t {tag}</dt>
  <dd>The file to edit and the initial cursor position depends on a
      &quot;tag&quot;, a sort of goto label. {tag} is looked up in the tags
      file, the associated file becomes the current file and the associated
      command is executed. Mostly this is used for C programs, in which case
      {tag} could be a function name. The effect is that the file containing
      that function becomes the current file and the cursor is positioned on the
      start of the function. See &quot;:help tag-commands&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>-q [errorfile]</dt>
  <dd>Start in quickFix mode. The file [errorfile] is read and the first error
      is displayed. If [errorfile] is omitted, the filename is obtained from the
      'errorfile' option (defaults to &quot;AztecC.Err&quot; for the Amiga,
      &quot;errors.err&quot; on other systems). Further errors can be jumped to
      with the &quot;:cn&quot; command. See &quot;:help quickfix&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"><b>Vim</b> behaves differently, depending on the name of the
    command (the executable may still be the same file).</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>vim</dt>
  <dd>The &quot;normal&quot; way, everything is default.</dd>
  <dt>ex</dt>
  <dd>Start in Ex mode. Go to Normal mode with the &quot;:vi&quot; command. Can
      also be done with the &quot;-e&quot; argument.</dd>
  <dt>view</dt>
  <dd>Start in read-only mode. You will be protected from writing the files. Can
      also be done with the &quot;-R&quot; argument.</dd>
  <dt>gvim gview</dt>
  <dd>The GUI version. Starts a new window. Can also be done with the
      &quot;-g&quot; argument.</dd>
  <dt>evim eview</dt>
  <dd>The GUI version in easy mode. Starts a new window. Can also be done with
      the &quot;-y&quot; argument.</dd>
  <dt>rvim rview rgvim rgview</dt>
  <dd>Like the above, but with restrictions. It will not be possible to start
      shell commands, or suspend <b>Vim.</b> Can also be done with the
      &quot;-Z&quot; argument.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The options may be given in any order, before or after filenames. Options
  without an argument can be combined after a single dash.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>+[num]</dt>
  <dd>For the first file the cursor will be positioned on line &quot;num&quot;.
      If &quot;num&quot; is missing, the cursor will be positioned on the last
      line.</dd>
  <dt>+/{pat}</dt>
  <dd>For the first file the cursor will be positioned in the line with the
      first occurrence of {pat}. See &quot;:help search-pattern&quot; for the
      available search patterns.</dd>
  <dt>+{command}</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>-c {command}</dt>
  <dd>{command} will be executed after the first file has been read. {command}
      is interpreted as an Ex command. If the {command} contains spaces it must
      be enclosed in double quotes (this depends on the shell that is used).
      Example: vim &quot;+set si&quot; main.c
    <br/>
    Note: You can use up to 10 &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-c&quot; commands.</dd>
  <dt>-S {file}</dt>
  <dd>{file} will be sourced after the first file has been read. This is
      equivalent to -c &quot;source {file}&quot;. {file} cannot start with '-'.
      If {file} is omitted &quot;Session.vim&quot; is used (only works when -S
      is the last argument).</dd>
  <dt>--cmd {command}</dt>
  <dd>Like using &quot;-c&quot;, but the command is executed just before
      processing any vimrc file. You can use up to 10 of these commands,
      independently from &quot;-c&quot; commands.</dd>
  <dt>-A</dt>
  <dd>If <b>Vim</b> has been compiled with ARABIC support for editing
      right-to-left oriented files and Arabic keyboard mapping, this option
      starts <b>Vim</b> in Arabic mode, i.e. 'arabic' is set. Otherwise an error
      message is given and <b>Vim</b> aborts.</dd>
  <dt>-b</dt>
  <dd>Binary mode. A few options will be set that makes it possible to edit a
      binary or executable file.</dd>
  <dt>-C</dt>
  <dd>Compatible. Set the 'compatible' option. This will make <b>Vim</b> behave
      mostly like Vi, even though a .vimrc file exists.</dd>
  <dt>-d</dt>
  <dd>Start in diff mode. There should be two, three or four file name
      arguments. <b>Vim</b> will open all the files and show differences between
      them. Works like vimdiff(1).</dd>
  <dt>-d {device}</dt>
  <dd>Open {device} for use as a terminal. Only on the Amiga. Example: &quot;-d
      con:20/30/600/150&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>-D</dt>
  <dd>Debugging. Go to debugging mode when executing the first command from a
      script.</dd>
  <dt>-e</dt>
  <dd>Start <b>Vim</b> in Ex mode, just like the executable was called
      &quot;ex&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>-E</dt>
  <dd>Start <b>Vim</b> in improved Ex mode, just like the executable was called
      &quot;exim&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>-f</dt>
  <dd>Foreground. For the GUI version, <b>Vim</b> will not fork and detach from
      the shell it was started in. On the Amiga, <b>Vim</b> is not restarted to
      open a new window. This option should be used when <b>Vim</b> is executed
      by a program that will wait for the edit session to finish (e.g. mail). On
      the Amiga the &quot;:sh&quot; and &quot;:!&quot; commands will not
    work.</dd>
  <dt>--nofork</dt>
  <dd>Foreground. For the GUI version, <b>Vim</b> will not fork and detach from
      the shell it was started in.</dd>
  <dt>-F</dt>
  <dd>If <b>Vim</b> has been compiled with FKMAP support for editing
      right-to-left oriented files and Farsi keyboard mapping, this option
      starts <b>Vim</b> in Farsi mode, i.e. 'fkmap' and 'rightleft' are set.
      Otherwise an error message is given and <b>Vim</b> aborts.</dd>
  <dt>-g</dt>
  <dd>If <b>Vim</b> has been compiled with GUI support, this option enables the
      GUI. If no GUI support was compiled in, an error message is given and
      <b>Vim</b> aborts.</dd>
  <dt>-h</dt>
  <dd>Give a bit of help about the command line arguments and options. After
      this <b>Vim</b> exits.</dd>
  <dt>-H</dt>
  <dd>If <b>Vim</b> has been compiled with RIGHTLEFT support for editing
      right-to-left oriented files and Hebrew keyboard mapping, this option
      starts <b>Vim</b> in Hebrew mode, i.e. 'hkmap' and 'rightleft' are set.
      Otherwise an error message is given and <b>Vim</b> aborts.</dd>
  <dt>-i {viminfo}</dt>
  <dd>Specifies the filename to use when reading or writing the viminfo file,
      instead of the default &quot;~/.viminfo&quot;. This can also be used to
      skip the use of the .viminfo file, by giving the name
    &quot;NONE&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>-L</dt>
  <dd>Same as -r.</dd>
  <dt>-l</dt>
  <dd>Lisp mode. Sets the 'lisp' and 'showmatch' options on.</dd>
  <dt>-m</dt>
  <dd>Modifying files is disabled. Resets the 'write' option. You can still
      modify the buffer, but writing a file is not possible.</dd>
  <dt>-M</dt>
  <dd>Modifications not allowed. The 'modifiable' and 'write' options will be
      unset, so that changes are not allowed and files can not be written. Note
      that these options can be set to enable making modifications.</dd>
  <dt>-N</dt>
  <dd>No-compatible mode. Resets the 'compatible' option. This will make
      <b>Vim</b> behave a bit better, but less Vi compatible, even though a
      .vimrc file does not exist.</dd>
  <dt>-n</dt>
  <dd>No swap file will be used. Recovery after a crash will be impossible.
      Handy if you want to edit a file on a very slow medium (e.g. floppy). Can
      also be done with &quot;:set uc=0&quot;. Can be undone with &quot;:set
      uc=200&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>-nb</dt>
  <dd>Become an editor server for NetBeans. See the docs for details.</dd>
  <dt>-o[N]</dt>
  <dd>Open N windows stacked. When N is omitted, open one window for each
    file.</dd>
  <dt>-O[N]</dt>
  <dd>Open N windows side by side. When N is omitted, open one window for each
      file.</dd>
  <dt>-p[N]</dt>
  <dd>Open N tab pages. When N is omitted, open one tab page for each file.</dd>
  <dt>-R</dt>
  <dd>Read-only mode. The 'readonly' option will be set. You can still edit the
      buffer, but will be prevented from accidentally overwriting a file. If you
      do want to overwrite a file, add an exclamation mark to the Ex command, as
      in &quot;:w!&quot;. The -R option also implies the -n option (see above).
      The 'readonly' option can be reset with &quot;:set noro&quot;. See
      &quot;:help 'readonly'&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>-r</dt>
  <dd>List swap files, with information about using them for recovery.</dd>
  <dt>-r {file}</dt>
  <dd>Recovery mode. The swap file is used to recover a crashed editing session.
      The swap file is a file with the same filename as the text file with
      &quot;.swp&quot; appended. See &quot;:help recovery&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>-s</dt>
  <dd>Silent mode. Only when started as &quot;Ex&quot; or when the
      &quot;-e&quot; option was given before the &quot;-s&quot; option.</dd>
  <dt>-s {scriptin}</dt>
  <dd>The script file {scriptin} is read. The characters in the file are
      interpreted as if you had typed them. The same can be done with the
      command &quot;:source! {scriptin}&quot;. If the end of the file is reached
      before the editor exits, further characters are read from the
    keyboard.</dd>
  <dt>-T {terminal}</dt>
  <dd>Tells <b>Vim</b> the name of the terminal you are using. Only required
      when the automatic way doesn't work. Should be a terminal known to
      <b>Vim</b> (builtin) or defined in the termcap or terminfo file.</dd>
  <dt>-u {vimrc}</dt>
  <dd>Use the commands in the file {vimrc} for initializations. All the other
      initializations are skipped. Use this to edit a special kind of files. It
      can also be used to skip all initializations by giving the name
      &quot;NONE&quot;. See &quot;:help initialization&quot; within vim for more
      details.</dd>
  <dt>-U {gvimrc}</dt>
  <dd>Use the commands in the file {gvimrc} for GUI initializations. All the
      other GUI initializations are skipped. It can also be used to skip all GUI
      initializations by giving the name &quot;NONE&quot;. See &quot;:help
      gui-init&quot; within vim for more details.</dd>
  <dt>-V[N]</dt>
  <dd>Verbose. Give messages about which files are sourced and for reading and
      writing a viminfo file. The optional number N is the value for 'verbose'.
      Default is 10.</dd>
  <dt>-v</dt>
  <dd>Start <b>Vim</b> in Vi mode, just like the executable was called
      &quot;vi&quot;. This only has effect when the executable is called
      &quot;ex&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>-w {scriptout}</dt>
  <dd>All the characters that you type are recorded in the file {scriptout},
      until you exit <b>Vim.</b> This is useful if you want to create a script
      file to be used with &quot;vim -s&quot; or &quot;:source!&quot;. If the
      {scriptout} file exists, characters are appended.</dd>
  <dt>-W {scriptout}</dt>
  <dd>Like -w, but an existing file is overwritten.</dd>
  <dt>-x</dt>
  <dd>Use encryption when writing files. Will prompt for a crypt key.</dd>
  <dt>-X</dt>
  <dd>Don't connect to the X server. Shortens startup time in a terminal, but
      the window title and clipboard will not be used.</dd>
  <dt>-y</dt>
  <dd>Start <b>Vim</b> in easy mode, just like the executable was called
      &quot;evim&quot; or &quot;eview&quot;. Makes <b>Vim</b> behave like a
      click-and-type editor.</dd>
  <dt>-Z</dt>
  <dd>Restricted mode. Works like the executable starts with &quot;r&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>--</dt>
  <dd>Denotes the end of the options. Arguments after this will be handled as a
      file name. This can be used to edit a filename that starts with a
    '-'.</dd>
  <dt>--echo-wid</dt>
  <dd>GTK GUI only: Echo the Window ID on stdout.</dd>
  <dt>--help</dt>
  <dd>Give a help message and exit, just like &quot;-h&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>--literal</dt>
  <dd>Take file name arguments literally, do not expand wildcards. This has no
      effect on Unix where the shell expands wildcards.</dd>
  <dt>--noplugin</dt>
  <dd>Skip loading plugins. Implied by -u NONE.</dd>
  <dt>--remote</dt>
  <dd>Connect to a Vim server and make it edit the files given in the rest of
      the arguments. If no server is found a warning is given and the files are
      edited in the current Vim.</dd>
  <dt>--remote-expr {expr}</dt>
  <dd>Connect to a Vim server, evaluate {expr} in it and print the result on
      stdout.</dd>
  <dt>--remote-send {keys}</dt>
  <dd>Connect to a Vim server and send {keys} to it.</dd>
  <dt>--remote-silent</dt>
  <dd>As --remote, but without the warning when no server is found.</dd>
  <dt>--remote-wait</dt>
  <dd>As --remote, but Vim does not exit until the files have been edited.</dd>
  <dt>--remote-wait-silent</dt>
  <dd>As --remote-wait, but without the warning when no server is found.</dd>
  <dt>--serverlist</dt>
  <dd>List the names of all Vim servers that can be found.</dd>
  <dt>--servername {name}</dt>
  <dd>Use {name} as the server name. Used for the current Vim, unless used with
      a --remote argument, then it's the name of the server to connect to.</dd>
  <dt>--socketid {id}</dt>
  <dd>GTK GUI only: Use the GtkPlug mechanism to run gvim in another
    window.</dd>
  <dt>--startuptime {file}</dt>
  <dd>During startup write timing messages to the file {fname}.</dd>
  <dt>--version</dt>

Probably. See &quot;:help todo&quot; for a list of known problems.
<p class="Pp">Note that a number of things that may be regarded as bugs by some,
    are in fact caused by a too-faithful reproduction of Vi's behaviour. And if
    you think other things are bugs &quot;because Vi does it differently&quot;,
    you should take a closer look at the vi_diff.txt file (or type :help
    vi_diff.txt when in Vim). Also have a look at the 'compatible' and
    'cpoptions' options.</p>
