The dynamic linker checks the following environment variables during the launch
  of each process.
<br/>
Note: If System Integrity Protection is enabled, these environment variables are
  ignored when executing binaries protected by System Integrity Protection.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH</b></dt>
  <dd>This is a colon separated list of directories that contain frameworks. The
      dynamic linker searches these directories before it searches for the
      framework by its install name. It allows you to test new versions of
      existing frameworks. (A framework is a library install name that ends in
      the form XXX.framework/Versions/A/XXX or XXX.framework/XXX, where XXX and
      A are any name.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>For each framework that a program uses, the dynamic linker looks for the
      framework in each directory in <small>DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH</small> in turn.
      If it looks in all those directories and can't find the framework, it uses
      whatever it would have loaded if DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH had not been
    set.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Use the <b>-L</b> option to <i>otool</i>(1) to discover the frameworks and
      shared libraries that the executable is linked against.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>DYLD_FALLBACK_FRAMEWORK_PATH</b></dt>
  <dd>This is a colon separated list of directories that contain frameworks. If
      a framework is not found at its install path, dyld uses this as a list of
      directories to search for the framework.
    <p class="Pp">By default, it is set to
        /Library/Frameworks:/System/Library/Frameworks</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>DYLD_VERSIONED_FRAMEWORK_PATH</b></dt>
  <dd>This is a colon separated list of directories that contain potential
      override frameworks. The dynamic linker searches these directories for
      frameworks. For each framework found dyld looks at its LC_ID_DYLIB and
      gets the current_version and install name. Dyld then looks for the
      framework at the install name path. Whichever has the larger
      current_version value will be used in the process whenever a framework
      with that install name is required. This is similar to DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH
      except instead of always overriding, it only overrides if the supplied
      framework is newer. Note: dyld does not check the framework's Info.plist
      to find its version. Dyld only checks the -currrent_version number
      supplied when the framework was created.</dd>
  <dt><b>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</b></dt>
  <dd>This is a colon separated list of directories that contain libraries. The
      dynamic linker searches these directories before it searches the default
      locations for libraries. It allows you to test new versions of existing
      libraries.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>For each dylib that a program uses, the dynamic linker looks for its leaf

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH</b></dt>
  <dd>This is a colon separated list of directories that contain libraries. If a
      dylib is not found at its install path, dyld uses this as a list of
      directories to search for the dylib. By default, it is set to
      /usr/local/lib:/usr/lib.</dd>
  <dt><b>DYLD_VERSIONED_LIBRARY_PATH</b></dt>
  <dd>This is a colon separated list of directories that contain potential
      override libraries. The dynamic linker searches these directories for
      dynamic libraries. For each library found dyld looks at its LC_ID_DYLIB
      and gets the current_version and install name. Dyld then looks for the
      library at the install name path. Whichever has the larger current_version
      value will be used in the process whenever a dylib with that install name
      is required. This is similar to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH except instead of always
      overriding, it only overrides is the supplied library is newer.</dd>
  <dt><b>DYLD_PRINT_TO_FILE</b></dt>
  <dd>This is a path to a (writable) file. Normally, the dynamic linker writes
      all logging output (triggered by DYLD_PRINT_* settings) to file descriptor
      2 (which is usually stderr). But this setting causes the dynamic linker to
      write logging output to the specified file.</dd>
  <dt><b>DYLD_SHARED_REGION</b></dt>
  <dd>This can be &quot;use&quot; (the default), &quot;avoid&quot;, or
      &quot;private&quot;. Setting it to &quot;avoid&quot; tells dyld to not use
      the shared cache. All OS dylibs are loaded dynamically just like every
      other dylib. Setting it to &quot;private&quot; tells dyld to remove the
      shared region from the process address space and mmap() back in a private
      copy of the dyld shared cache in the shared region address range. This is
      only useful if the shared cache on disk has been updated and is different
      than the shared cache in use.</dd>
  <dt><b>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</b></dt>
  <dd>This is a colon separated list of dynamic libraries to load before the
      ones specified in the program. This lets you test new modules of existing
      dynamic shared libraries that are used in flat-namespace images by loading
      a temporary dynamic shared library with just the new modules. Note that
      this has no effect on images built a two-level namespace images using a
      dynamic shared library unless <small>DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE</small> is
      also used.</dd>
  <dt><b>DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE</b></dt>
  <dd>Force all images in the program to be linked as flat-namespace images and
      ignore any two-level namespace bindings. This may cause programs to fail
      to execute with a multiply defined symbol error if two-level namespace
      images are used to allow the images to have multiply defined symbols.</dd>
  <dt><b>DYLD_IMAGE_SUFFIX</b></dt>
  <dd>This is set to a string of a suffix to try to be used for all shared
      libraries used by the program. For libraries ending in &quot;.dylib&quot;
      the suffix is applied just before the &quot;.dylib&quot;. For all other
      libraries the suffix is appended to the library name. This is useful for
      using conventional &quot;_profile&quot; and &quot;_debug&quot; libraries
      and frameworks.</dd>
  <dt><b>DYLD_PRINT_OPTS</b></dt>
  <dd>When this is set, the dynamic linker writes to file descriptor 2 (normally
      standard error) the command line options.</dd>
  <dt><b>DYLD_PRINT_ENV</b></dt>
  <dd>When this is set, the dynamic linker writes to file descriptor 2 (normally
      standard error) the environment variables.</dd>
  <dt><b>DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES</b></dt>
  <dd>When this is set, the dynamic linker writes to file descriptor 2 (normally
      standard error) the filenames of the libraries the program is using. This
      is useful to make sure that the use of <small>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</small> is
      getting what you want.</dd>
  <dt><b>DYLD_BIND_AT_LAUNCH</b></dt>
  <dd>When this is set, the dynamic linker binds all undefined symbols the
      program needs at launch time. This includes function symbols that are
      normally lazily bound at the time of their first call.</dd>
  <dt><b>DYLD_PRINT_STATISTICS</b></dt>
  <dd>Right before the process's main() is called, dyld prints out information
      about how dyld spent its time. Useful for analyzing launch
    performance.</dd>
  <dt><b>DYLD_PRINT_STATISTICS_DETAILS</b></dt>
  <dd>Right before the process's main() is called, dyld prints out detailed
      information about how dyld spent its time. Useful for analyzing launch
      performance.</dd>
  <dt><b>DYLD_DISABLE_DOFS</b></dt>
  <dd>Causes dyld to not register dtrace static probes with the kernel.</dd>
  <dt><b>DYLD_PRINT_INITIALIZERS</b></dt>
  <dd>Causes dyld to print out a line when running each initializer in every
      image. Initializers run by dyld include constructors for C++ statically
      allocated objects, functions marked with __attribute__((constructor)), and
      -init functions.</dd>
  <dt><b>DYLD_PRINT_APIS</b></dt>
  <dd>Causes dyld to print a line whenever a dyld API is called (e.g.
      NSAddImage()).</dd>
  <dt><b>DYLD_PRINT_SEGMENTS</b></dt>
  <dd>Causes dyld to print out a line containing the name and address range of
      each mach-o segment that dyld maps. In addition it prints information
      about if the image was from the dyld shared cache.</dd>
  <dt><b>DYLD_PRINT_BINDINGS</b></dt>
  <dd>Causes dyld to print a line each time a symbolic name is bound.</dd>
  <dt><b>DYLD_PRINT_DOFS</b></dt>
  <dd>Causes dyld to print out information about dtrace static probes registered
      with the kernel.</dd>
  <dt><b>DYLD_PRINT_RPATHS</b></dt>
  <dd>Cause dyld to print a line each time it expands an @rpath variable and
      whether that expansion was successful or not.</dd>
  <dt><b>DYLD_SHARED_CACHE_DIR</b></dt>
  <dd>This is a directory containing dyld shared cache files. This variable can
      be used in conjunction with DYLD_SHARED_REGION=private to run a process
      with an alternate shared cache.</dd>

  LIBRARY LOADING</a></h1>
Unlike many other operating systems, Darwin does not locate dependent dynamic
  libraries via their leaf file name. Instead the full path to each dylib is
  used (e.g. /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib). But there are times when a full path
  is not appropriate; for instance, may want your binaries to be installable in
  anywhere on the disk. To support that, there are three @xxx/ variables that
  can be used as a path prefix. At runtime dyld substitutes a dynamically
  generated path for the @xxx/ prefix.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>@executable_path/</b></dt>
  <dd>This variable is replaced with the path to the directory containing the
      main executable for the process. This is useful for loading
      dylibs/frameworks embedded in a .app directory. If the main executable
      file is at /some/path/My.app/Contents/MacOS/My and a framework dylib file
      is at /some/path/My.app/Contents/Frameworks/Foo.framework/Versions/A/Foo,
      then the framework load path could be encoded as
      @executable_path/../Frameworks/Foo.framework/Versions/A/Foo and the .app
      directory could be moved around in the file system and dyld will still be
      able to load the embedded framework.</dd>
  <dt><b>@loader_path/</b></dt>
  <dd>This variable is replaced with the path to the directory containing the
      mach-o binary which contains the load command using @loader_path. Thus, in
      every binary, @loader_path resolves to a different path, whereas
      @executable_path always resolves to the same path. @loader_path is useful
      as the load path for a framework/dylib embedded in a plug-in, if the final
      file system location of the plugin-in unknown (so absolute paths cannot be
      used) or if the plug-in is used by multiple applications (so
      @executable_path cannot be used). If the plug-in mach-o file is at
      /some/path/Myfilter.plugin/Contents/MacOS/Myfilter and a framework dylib
      file is at
      /some/path/Myfilter.plugin/Contents/Frameworks/Foo.framework/Versions/A/Foo,
      then the framework load path could be encoded as
      @loader_path/../Frameworks/Foo.framework/Versions/A/Foo and the
      Myfilter.plugin directory could be moved around in the file system and
      dyld will still be able to load the embedded framework.</dd>
  <dt><b>@rpath/</b></dt>
  <dd>Dyld maintains a current stack of paths called the run path list. When
      @rpath is encountered it is substituted with each path in the run path
      list until a loadable dylib if found. The run path stack is built from the
      LC_RPATH load commands in the depencency chain that lead to the current
      dylib load. You can add an LC_RPATH load command to an image with the
      -rpath option to ld(1). You can even add a LC_RPATH load command path that
      starts with @loader_path/, and it will push a path on the run path stack
      that relative to the image containing the LC_RPATH. The use of @rpath is
      most useful when you have a complex directory structure of programs and
      dylibs which can be installed anywhere, but keep their relative positions.
      This scenario could be implemented using @loader_path, but every client of
      a dylib could need a different load path because its relative position in
      the file system is different. The use of @rpath introduces a level of
      indirection that simplies things. You pick a location in your directory
      structure as an anchor point. Each dylib then gets an install path that
      starts with @rpath and is the path to the dylib relative to the anchor
      point. Each main executable is linked with -rpath @loader_path/zzz, where
      zzz is the path from the executable to the anchor point. At runtime dyld
      sets it run path to be the anchor point, then each dylib is found relative
      to the anchor point.</dd>
