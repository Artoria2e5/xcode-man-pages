The <code class="Fn">pthread_exit</code>() function terminates the calling
  thread and makes the value <var class="Fa">value_ptr</var> available to any
  successful join with the terminating thread. Any cancellation cleanup handlers
  that have been pushed and are not yet popped are popped in the reverse order
  that they were pushed and then executed. After all cancellation handlers have
  been executed, if the thread has any thread-specific data, appropriate
  destructor functions are called in an unspecified order. Thread termination
  does not release any application visible process resources, including, but not
  limited to, mutexes and file descriptors, nor does it perform any process
  level cleanup actions, including, but not limited to, calling
  <code class="Fn">atexit</code>() routines that may exist.
<p class="Pp">An implicit call to <code class="Fn">pthread_exit</code>() is made
    when a thread other than the thread in which <code class="Fn">main</code>()
    was first invoked returns from the start routine that was used to create it.
    The function's return value serves as the thread's exit status.</p>
<p class="Pp">The behavior of <code class="Fn">pthread_exit</code>() is
    undefined if called from a cancellation handler or destructor function that
    was invoked as the result of an implicit or explicit call to
    <code class="Fn">pthread_exit</code>().</p>
<p class="Pp">After a thread has terminated, the result of access to local
    (auto) variables of the thread is undefined. Thus, references to local
    variables of the exiting thread should not be used for the
    <code class="Fn">pthread_exit</code>() <var class="Fa">value_ptr</var>
    parameter value.</p>
<p class="Pp">The process will exit with an exit status of 0 after the last
    thread has been terminated. The behavior is as if the implementation called
    <code class="Fn">exit</code>() with a zero argument at thread termination
    time.</p>
