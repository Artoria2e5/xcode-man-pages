   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

Historically, the former InterNIC managed (under the auspices of IANA) the
  allocation of IP numbers to ISPs and other organizations. This changed
  somewhat when the Regional Internet Registry system was started, with the
  creation of three (and later, four) Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) around
  the world, each managing the allocation of IP addresses to organizations
  within differing physical areas (see also RFC2050).
<p class="Pp">This means that there is no central whois database for IP
  numbers.</p>
<p class="Pp">This module allows the user to lookup the RIR who has authority
    for a particular IP address. After finding out the authority for an IP
    address, it is possible to use the authority's whois server to lookup the
    netblock owner.</p>
