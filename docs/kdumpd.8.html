<code class="Nm">Kdumpd</code> is a server which receives kernel states in the
  form of a core dump from a remote Mac OS X machine. The kdumpd server operates
  on UDP port 1069, although this may be configurable in the future. The server
  should be started by <a class="Xr">inetd(8)</a>.
<p class="Pp">The server should have the user ID with the lowest possible
    privilege, usually the user &quot;nobody&quot;. The directory specified as a
    server program argument in <span class="Pa">/etc/inetd.conf</span> directs
    the server to store kernel cores in that directory and nowhere else. The
    server returns an EEXIST error to the remote kernel if it receives a request
    for an existing file - i.e. only new files can be created. The server also
    disallows path specifications in the incoming file name.</p>

The <code class="Nm">kdumpd</code> command is based on Berkeley
  <a class="Xr">tftpd(8)</a> by way of FreeBSD, with several modifications.
