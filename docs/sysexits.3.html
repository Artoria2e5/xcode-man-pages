According to <a class="Xr">style(9)</a>, it is not a good practice to call
  <a class="Xr">exit(3)</a> with arbitrary values to indicate a failure
  condition when ending a program. Instead, the pre-defined exit codes from
  <code class="Nm">sysexits</code> should be used, so the caller of the process
  can get a rough estimation about the failure class without looking up the
  source code.
<p class="Pp">The successful exit is always indicated by a status of 0, or
    <b class="Sy">EX_OK</b>. Error numbers begin at <b class="Sy">EX__BASE</b>
    to reduce the possibility of clashing with other exit statuses that random
    programs may already return. The meaning of the codes is approximately as
    follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b class="Sy">EX_USAGE</b> (64)</dt>
  <dd>The command was used incorrectly, e.g., with the wrong number of
      arguments, a bad flag, a bad syntax in a parameter, or whatever.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">EX_DATAERR</b> (65)</dt>
  <dd>The input data was incorrect in some way. This should only be used for
      user's data and not system files.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">EX_NOINPUT</b> (66)</dt>
  <dd>An input file (not a system file) did not exist or was not readable. This
      could also include errors like &#x201C;No message&#x201D; to a mailer (if
      it cared to catch it).</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">EX_NOUSER</b> (67)</dt>
  <dd>The user specified did not exist. This might be used for mail addresses or
      remote logins.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">EX_NOHOST</b> (68)</dt>
  <dd>The host specified did not exist. This is used in mail addresses or
      network requests.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">EX_UNAVAILABLE</b> (69)</dt>
  <dd>A service is unavailable. This can occur if a support program or file does
      not exist. This can also be used as a catchall message when something you
      wanted to do doesn't work, but you don't know why.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">EX_SOFTWARE</b> (70)</dt>
  <dd>An internal software error has been detected. This should be limited to
      non-operating system related errors as possible.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">EX_OSERR</b> (71)</dt>
  <dd>An operating system error has been detected. This is intended to be used
      for such things as &#x201C;cannot fork&#x201D;, &#x201C;cannot create
      pipe&#x201D;, or the like. It includes things like getuid returning a user
      that does not exist in the passwd file.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">EX_OSFILE</b> (72)</dt>
  <dd>Some system file (e.g., <span class="Pa">/etc/passwd</span>,
      <span class="Pa">/var/run/utmp</span>, etc.) does not exist, cannot be
      opened, or has some sort of error (e.g., syntax error).</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">EX_CANTCREAT</b> (73)</dt>
  <dd>A (user specified) output file cannot be created.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">EX_IOERR</b> (74)</dt>
  <dd>An error occurred while doing I/O on some file.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">EX_TEMPFAIL</b> (75)</dt>
  <dd>Temporary failure, indicating something that is not really an error. In
      sendmail, this means that a mailer (e.g.) could not create a connection,
      and the request should be reattempted later.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">EX_PROTOCOL</b> (76)</dt>
  <dd>The remote system returned something that was &#x201C;not possible&#x201D;
      during a protocol exchange.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">EX_NOPERM</b> (77)</dt>
  <dd>You did not have sufficient permission to perform the operation. This is
      not intended for file system problems, which should use
      <b class="Sy">EX_NOINPUT</b> or <b class="Sy">EX_CANTCREAT</b>, but rather
      for higher level permissions.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">EX_CONFIG</b> (78)</dt>
  <dd>Something was found in an unconfigured or misconfigured state.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The numerical values corresponding to the symbolical ones are
    given in parenthesis for easy reference.</p>
