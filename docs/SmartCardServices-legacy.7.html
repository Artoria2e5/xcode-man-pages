<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<code class="Nm">SmartCardServices-legacy</code> is a set of deprecated
  components which add support for SmartCards to macOS based on Tokend modules.
  Since OS X 10.12, there is SmartCard support which is described in
  <a class="Xr">SmartCardServices(7)</a> In macOS 10.15 this support is disabled
  by default.
<p class="Pp">Supported SmartCards appear as separate keychains. A Tokend module
    for each SmartCard must be installed in
    <span class="Pa">/Library/Security/tokend</span></p>

  LEGACY SMART CARD SUPPORT</a></h1>
It is possible to turn on the legacy tokends by setting the global preference:
<p class="Pp"><code class="Li">sudo defaults write
    /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.smartcard Legacy -bool
  true</code></p>
<p class="Pp">The system will ask the user for confirmation before enabling the
    legacy support. This configuration change will also require reboot.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="USB_SMART_CARD_READER_DRIVERS"><a class="permalink" href="#USB_SMART_CARD_READER_DRIVERS">USB
  SMART CARD READER DRIVERS</a></h1>
macOS has built-in support for USB CCID class-compliant SmartCard readers. For
  other readers, install the reader driver in
  <span class="Pa">/usr/local/libexec/SmartCardServices/drivers</span>. Each
  driver is a bundle. The bundle contains an XML file Info.plist which contains
  the device's USB vendor ID and product ID. For detailed description of the
  plist format and how to write a reader driver, see
  http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/api/group__IFDHandler.html

<h1 class="Sh" id="SMART_CARD_APDU_LOGGING"><a class="permalink" href="#SMART_CARD_APDU_LOGGING">SMART
  CARD APDU LOGGING</a></h1>
It is possible to turn on logging for SmartCards by setting the global
  preference:
<p class="Pp"><code class="Li">sudo defaults write
    /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.smartcard Logging -bool
  yes</code></p>
<p class="Pp">After a SmartCard reader is connected (or after reboot) all
    operations including contents of sent and received APDU messages are then
    logged into the system log. Logging uses the facility
    com.apple.security.smartcard.log so it is possible to set up filtering of
    these logs into custom targets (see <a class="Xr">asl.conf(5)</a>)</p>
<p class="Pp">To avoid security risks that could occur if logging is turned on
    indefinitely, the logging setting is one-shot - it must be turned on by the
    command above to start logging again with a new reader. This includes
    unplugging and replugging the same reader.</p>

It is possible to turn of the new tokens by setting the global preference:
<p class="Pp"><code class="Li">sudo defaults write
    /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.smartcard DisabledTokens -array
    com.apple.CryptoTokenKit.pivtoken</code></p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DISABLING_SHEET_AUTHORIZATION_IN_PREFERENCES"><a class="permalink" href="#DISABLING_SHEET_AUTHORIZATION_IN_PREFERENCES">DISABLING
  SHEET AUTHORIZATION IN PREFERENCES</a></h1>
When using tokend-based SmartCards, according to your configuration you may not
  be able to use SmartCards for authorization in System Preferences sheets. In
  such case, you can disable sheets using following command:
<p class="Pp"><code class="Li">defaults write com.apple.Preferences UseSheets
    -bool FALSE</code></p>
<p class="Pp">System Preferences will then use the original dialog-based
    authorization.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="ENTITLEMENT"><a class="permalink" href="#ENTITLEMENT">ENTITLEMENT</a></h1>
Sandboxed PCSC clients require 'com.apple.security.smartcard=YES' entitlement.
  Non-sandboxed PCSC clients do not require such entitlement (in order to keep
  backward compatibility with macOS &lt; 10.10).
