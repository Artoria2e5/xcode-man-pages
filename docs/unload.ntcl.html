   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

This command tries to unload shared libraries previously loaded with <b>load</b>
  from the application's address space. <i>fileName</i> is the name of the file
  containing the library file to be unload; it must be the same as the filename
  provided to <b>load</b> for loading the library. The <i>packageName</i>
  argument is the name of the package (as determined by or passed to
  <b>load</b>), and is used to compute the name of the unload procedure; if not
  supplied, it is computed from <i>fileName</i> in the same manner as
  <b>load</b>. The <i>interp</i> argument is the path name of the interpreter
  from which to unload the package (see the <b>interp</b> manual entry for
  details); if <i>interp</i> is omitted, it defaults to the interpreter in which
  the <b>unload</b> command was invoked.
<p class="Pp">If the initial arguments to <b>unload</b> start with <b>-</b> then
    they are treated as switches. The following switches are currently
    supported:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-nocomplain</b></dt>
  <dd>Suppresses all error messages. If this switch is given, <b>unload</b> will
      never report an error.</dd>
  <dt><b>-keeplibrary</b></dt>
  <dd>This switch will prevent <b>unload</b> from issuing the operating system
      call that will unload the library from the process.</dd>
  <dt><b>--</b></dt>
  <dd>Marks the end of switches. The argument following this one will be treated
      as a <i>fileName</i> even if it starts with a <b>-</b>.</dd>

<h2 class="Ss" id="UNLOAD_OPERATION"><a class="permalink" href="#UNLOAD_OPERATION">UNLOAD
  OPERATION</a></h2>
When a file containing a shared library is loaded through the <b>load</b>
  command, Tcl associates two reference counts to the library file. The first
  counter shows how many times the library has been loaded into normal (trusted)
  interpreters while the second describes how many times the library has been
  loaded into safe interpreters. As a file containing a shared library can be
  loaded only once by Tcl (with the first <b>load</b> call on the file), these
  counters track how many interpreters use the library. Each subsequent call to
  <b>load</b> after the first simply increments the proper reference count.
<p class="Pp"><b>unload</b> works in the opposite direction. As a first step,
    <b>unload</b> will check whether the library is unloadable: an unloadable
    library exports a special unload procedure. The name of the unload procedure
    is determined by <i>packageName</i> and whether or not the target
    interpreter is a safe one. For normal interpreters the name of the
    initialization procedure will have the form <i>pkg</i><b>_Unload</b>, where
    <i>pkg</i> is the same as <i>packageName</i> except that the first letter is
    converted to upper case and all other letters are converted to lower case.
    For example, if <i>packageName</i> is <b>foo</b> or <b>FOo</b>, the
    initialization procedure's name will be <b>Foo_Unload</b>. If the target
    interpreter is a safe interpreter, then the name of the initialization
    procedure will be <i>pkg</i><b>_SafeUnload</b> instead of
    <i>pkg</i><b>_Unload</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>unload</b> determines that a library is not unloadable (or
    unload functionality has been disabled during compilation), an error will be
    returned. If the library is unloadable, then <b>unload</b> will call the
    unload procedure. If the unload procedure returns <b>TCL_OK</b>,
    <b>unload</b> will proceed and decrease the proper reference count
    (depending on the target interpreter type). When both reference counts have
    reached 0, the library will be detached from the process.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="UNLOAD_HOOK_PROTOTYPE"><a class="permalink" href="#UNLOAD_HOOK_PROTOTYPE">UNLOAD
  HOOK PROTOTYPE</a></h2>
The unload procedure must match the following prototype:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef int Tcl_PackageUnloadProc(Tcl_Interp *<i>interp</i>, int <i>flags</i>);
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <i>interp</i> argument identifies the interpreter from which
    the library is to be unloaded. The unload procedure must return
    <b>TCL_OK</b> or <b>TCL_ERROR</b> to indicate whether or not it completed
    successfully; in the event of an error it should set the interpreter's
    result to point to an error message. In this case, the result of the
    <b>unload</b> command will be the result returned by the unload
  procedure.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>flags</i> argument can be either
    <b>TCL_UNLOAD_DETACH_FROM_INTERPRETER</b> or
    <b>TCL_UNLOAD_DETACH_FROM_PROCESS</b>. In case the library will remain
    attached to the process after the unload procedure returns (i.e. because the
    library is used by other interpreters),
    <b>TCL_UNLOAD_DETACH_FROM_INTERPRETER</b> will be defined. However, if the
    library is used only by the target interpreter and the library will be
    detached from the application as soon as the unload procedure returns, the
    <i>flags</i> argument will be set to
  <b>TCL_UNLOAD_DETACH_FROM_PROCESS</b>.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h2>
The <b>unload</b> command cannot unload libraries that are statically linked
  with the application. If <i>fileName</i> is an empty string, then the
  <i>packageName</i> argument must be specified.
<p class="Pp">If <i>packageName</i> is omitted or specified as an empty string,
    Tcl tries to guess the name of the package. This may be done differently on
    different platforms. The default guess, which is used on most UNIX
    platforms, is to take the last element of <i>fileName</i>, strip off the
    first three characters if they are <b>lib</b>, and use any following
    alphabetic and underline characters as the module name. For example, the
    command <b>unload libxyz4.2.so</b> uses the module name <b>xyz</b> and the
    command <b>unload bin/last.so {}</b> uses the module name <b>last</b>.</p>

If the same file is <b>load</b>ed by different <i>fileName</i>s, it will be
  loaded into the process's address space multiple times. The behavior of this
  varies from system to system (some systems may detect the redundant loads,
  others may not). In case a library has been silently detached by the operating
  system (and as a result Tcl thinks the library is still loaded), it may be
  dangerous to use <b>unload</b> on such a library (as the library will be
  completely detached from the application while some interpreters will continue
  to use it).

<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLE"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLE">EXAMPLE</a></h1>
If an unloadable module in the file <b>foobar.dll</b> had been loaded using the
  <b>load</b> command like this (on Windows):
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
load c:/some/dir/foobar.dll
</pre>
</div>
then it would be unloaded like this:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>unload</b> c:/some/dir/foobar.dll
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This allows a C code module to be installed temporarily into a
    long-running Tcl program and then removed again (either because it is no
    longer needed or because it is being updated with a new version) without
    having to shut down the overall Tcl process.</p>
