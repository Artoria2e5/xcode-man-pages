DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated::Pool - Manage a pool of replicants
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="permalink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
This class is used internally by DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated. You
  shouldn't need to create instances of this class.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
In a replicated storage type, there is at least one replicant to handle the
  read-only traffic. The Pool class manages this replicant, or list of
  replicants, and gives some methods for querying information about their
  status.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ATTRIBUTES"><a class="permalink" href="#ATTRIBUTES">ATTRIBUTES</a></h1>
This class defines the following attributes.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="maximum_lag_($num)"><a class="permalink" href="#maximum_lag_($num)">maximum_lag
  ($num)</a></h2>
This is a number which defines the maximum allowed lag returned by the
  &quot;lag_behind_master&quot; in DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI method. The default
  is 0. In general, this should return a larger number when the replicant is
  lagging behind its master, however the implementation of this is database
  specific, so don't count on this number having a fixed meaning. For example,
  MySQL will return a number of seconds that the replicating database is
  lagging.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="last_validated"><a class="permalink" href="#last_validated">last_validated</a></h2>
This is an integer representing a time since the last time the replicants were
  validated. It's nothing fancy, just an integer provided via the perl time
  built-in.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="replicant_type_($classname)"><a class="permalink" href="#replicant_type_($classname)">replicant_type
  ($classname)</a></h2>
Base class used to instantiate replicants that are in the pool. Unless you need
  to subclass DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated::Replicant you should just
  leave this alone.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="replicants"><a class="permalink" href="#replicants">replicants</a></h2>
A hashref of replicant, with the key being the dsn and the value returning the
  actual replicant storage. For example, if the <span class="Li">$dsn</span>
  element is something like:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  &quot;dbi:SQLite:dbname=dbfile&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You could access the specific replicant via:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  $schema-&gt;storage-&gt;replicants-&gt;{'dbname=dbfile'}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This attributes also supports the following helper methods:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>set_replicant($key=&gt;$storage)</dt>
  <dd>Pushes a replicant onto the HashRef under
    <span class="Li">$key</span></dd>
  <dt>get_replicant($key)</dt>
  <dd>Retrieves the named replicant</dd>
  <dt>has_replicants</dt>
  <dd>Returns true if the Pool defines replicants.</dd>
  <dt>num_replicants</dt>
  <dd>The number of replicants in the pool</dd>
  <dt>delete_replicant ($key)</dt>
  <dd>Removes the replicant under <span class="Li">$key</span> from the
    pool</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="master"><a class="permalink" href="#master">master</a></h2>
Reference to the master Storage.
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="METHODS"><a class="permalink" href="#METHODS">METHODS</a></h1>
This class defines the following methods.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="connect_replicants_($schema,_Array_$connect_info_)"><a class="permalink" href="#connect_replicants_($schema,_Array_$connect_info_)">connect_replicants
  ($schema, Array[$connect_info])</a></h2>
Given an array of <span class="Li">$dsn</span> or connect_info structures
  suitable for connected to a database, create an
  DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated::Replicant object and store it in the
  &quot;replicants&quot; attribute.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="connect_replicant_($schema,_$connect_info)"><a class="permalink" href="#connect_replicant_($schema,_$connect_info)">connect_replicant
  ($schema, $connect_info)</a></h2>
Given a schema object and a hashref of <span class="Li">$connect_info</span>,
  connect the replicant and return it.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_safely_ensure_connected_($replicant)"><a class="permalink" href="#_safely_ensure_connected_($replicant)">_safely_ensure_connected
  ($replicant)</a></h2>
The standard ensure_connected method with throw an exception should it fail to
  connect. For the master database this is desirable, but since replicants are
  allowed to fail, this behavior is not desirable. This method wraps the call to
  ensure_connected in an eval in order to catch any generated errors. That way a
  slave can go completely offline (e.g. the box itself can die) without bringing
  down your entire pool of databases.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_safely_($replicant,_$name,_$code)"><a class="permalink" href="#_safely_($replicant,_$name,_$code)">_safely
  ($replicant, $name, $code)</a></h2>
Execute <span class="Li">$code</span> for operation
  <span class="Li">$name</span> catching any exceptions and printing an error
  message to the
  <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;$replicant-&quot;</span>debugobj&gt;&gt;.
<p class="Pp">Returns 1 on success and undef on failure.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="connected_replicants"><a class="permalink" href="#connected_replicants">connected_replicants</a></h2>
Returns true if there are connected replicants. Actually is overloaded to return
  the number of replicants. So you can do stuff like:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  if( my $num_connected = $storage-&gt;has_connected_replicants ) {
    print &quot;I have $num_connected connected replicants&quot;;
  } else {
    print &quot;Sorry, no replicants.&quot;;
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This method will actually test that each replicant in the
    &quot;replicants&quot; hashref is actually connected, try not to hit this 10
    times a second.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="active_replicants"><a class="permalink" href="#active_replicants">active_replicants</a></h2>
This is an array of replicants that are considered to be active in the pool.
  This does not check to see if they are connected, but if they are not, DBIC
  should automatically reconnect them for us when we hit them with a query.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="all_replicants"><a class="permalink" href="#all_replicants">all_replicants</a></h2>
Just a simple array of all the replicant storages. No particular order to the
  array is given, nor should any meaning be derived.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="validate_replicants"><a class="permalink" href="#validate_replicants">validate_replicants</a></h2>
This does a check to see if 1) each replicate is connected (or reconnectable),
  2) that is -&gt;is_replicating, and 3) that it is not exceeding the lag amount
  defined by &quot;maximum_lag&quot;. Replicants that fail any of these tests
  are set to inactive, and thus removed from the replication pool.
<p class="Pp">This tests &quot;all_replicants&quot;, since a replicant that has
    been previous marked as inactive can be reactivated should it start to pass
    the validation tests again.</p>
<p class="Pp">See DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI for more about checking if a
    replicating connection is not following a master or is lagging.</p>
<p class="Pp">Calling this method will generate queries on the replicant
    databases so it is not recommended that you run them very often.</p>
<p class="Pp">This method requires that your underlying storage engine supports
    some sort of native replication mechanism. Currently only MySQL native
    replication is supported. Your patches to make other replication types work
    are welcomed.</p>
