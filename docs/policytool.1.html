The policy for a Java runtime (specifying which permissions are available for
  code from various sources, when executing as various principals) is
  represented by a Policy object. The default Policy implementation obtains its
  information from static ASCII policy configuration files.
<p class="Pp">A policy file can be composed via a simple text editor, or via the
    graphical Policy Tool utility described here. Using the Policy Tool saves
    typing and eliminates the need for you to know the required policy file
    syntax thus reducing errors.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Starting_Policy_Tool"><a class="permalink" href="#Starting_Policy_Tool">Starting
  Policy Tool</a></h2>
To start Policy Tool, simply type the following at the command line.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b></b>
<pre>
policytool
</pre>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>This brings up the &quot;Policy Tool&quot; window.</dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Whenever Policy Tool is started, it tries to fill in this window
    with policy information from what is sometimes referred to as the &quot;user
    policy file&quot;. The user policy file is by default a file named
    .java.policy in your home directory. If Policy Tool cannot find the user
    policy file, it reports the situation and displays a blank &quot;Policy
    Tool&quot; window (that is, a window with headings and buttons but no data
    in it).</p>
<p class="Pp">You can then proceed to either open whatever policy file you want
    to work on or create a new policy file, by adding policy entries, optionally
    specifying a keystore, and saving the file).</p>
<p class="Pp">The first time you run the Policy Tool, there will not be a user
    policy file (unless you created one manually).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Creating_a_new_Policy_File"><a class="permalink" href="#Creating_a_new_Policy_File">Creating
  a new Policy File</a></h2>
To create a new policy file, start by simply selecting the New command from the
  File menu. This will close the currently open policy file (if any, after first
  prompting you to save it if needed) and bring up a new policy tool window,
  that is, a window with headings and buttons but no data in it.
<p class="Pp">Please Note: this is not necessary the first time you run the
    Policy Tool. Since the tool tries to open the user policy file and one
    doesn't exist yet (unless it was created manually), the tool will bring up a
    window without any data in it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once you have a new policy tool window, you can then create the
    policy entries, and specify the keystore (if any of the policy entries
    specify a keystore alias). At any point, you can save the policy file.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Opening_a_Different_Policy_File"><a class="permalink" href="#Opening_a_Different_Policy_File">Opening
  a Different Policy File</a></h2>
To work on a different policy file than the one currently being worked on (if
  any), use the Open command in the File menu.
<p class="Pp">This will close the currently open policy file (if any, after
    first prompting you to save it if needed) and will present you with an Open
    dialog, which you can use to navigate the directory structure until you get
    to the directory containing the policy file you want to work on. Select that
    file, then select the OK button.</p>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;Policy Tool&quot; window will then be filled in with
    information from the policy file, including the policy file name, the
    keystore URL (if any), and the CodeBase, SignedBy and Principal parts of
    each policy entry in the policy file.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Specifying_the_Keystore"><a class="permalink" href="#Specifying_the_Keystore">Specifying
  the Keystore</a></h2>
To specify the keystore containing the key information for the aliases specified
  in the SignedBy parts of policy entries, select the Change Keystore command in
  the Edit menu.
<p class="Pp">This brings up a dialog box in which you specify the new keystore
    URL and optionally the keystore type.</p>
<p class="Pp">As an example, to specify the keystore named
    &quot;mykeystore&quot; in the /tests/ directory, type the following file:
    URL into the text box labeled &quot;New KeyStore URL&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b></b>
<pre>
file:/tests/mykeystore
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">To also specify that the keystore type is &quot;JKS&quot; (the
    proprietary keystore type supported by Sun Microsystems), type the following
    into the text box labeled &quot;New KeyStore Type&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b></b>
<pre>
JKS
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">When you are done specifying the keystore URL and type (if any),
    select OK (or you can select Cancel to cancel the operation). If you didn't
    cancel, the text box labeled &quot;Keystore:&quot; is now filled in with the
    keystore URL and type.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Adding_a_New_Policy_Entry"><a class="permalink" href="#Adding_a_New_Policy_Entry">Adding
  a New Policy Entry</a></h2>
To add a new policy entry, select the Add Policy Entry button in the main
  &quot;Policy Tool&quot; window. This brings up a &quot;Policy Entry&quot;
  dialog box.
<p class="Pp">Using this dialog box, you specify</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>an optional CodeBase entry indicating the URL location where the code
      originates from. For example, to indicate code from the local
      /JavaSoft/TESTS/ directory, type the following file URL into the CodeBase
      text box:</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b></b>
<pre>
file:/JavaSoft/TESTS
</pre>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>an optional SignedBy entry indicating the alias name from the keystore
      used to reference the signer whose private key was used to sign the code.
      For example, to indicate the alias named &quot;duke&quot;, simply type the
      following into the SignedBy text box:</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b></b>
<pre>
duke
</pre>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>an optional Principals entry indicating the list of principals that the
      code has to be executed as in order for the permission(s) to be granted.
      See Adding a New Principal.</dd>
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>one or more permission entries indicating which permissions are granted to
      the code from the source indicated by the CodeBase and SignedBy values (or
      to any code if no such values are specified) when running as the specified
      principals in the Principals list. See Adding a New Permission.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Editing_a_Policy_Entry"><a class="permalink" href="#Editing_a_Policy_Entry">Editing
  a Policy Entry</a></h2>
To edit an existing policy entry, select the line for that entry in the main
  &quot;Policy Tool&quot; window, then select the Edit Policy Entry button.
  Alternatively, you can simply double-click the line for that entry.
<p class="Pp">This brings up the same type of &quot;Policy Entry&quot; dialog
    box as appears when you are adding a new policy entry, except in this case
    the dialog box is filled in with the existing policy entry information. To
    change the information, simply retype it (for the CodeBase and SignedBy
    values) or use the buttons (for the Principals and Permissions values).</p>
<p class="Pp">When you are done, select the Done button (or Cancel to
  cancel).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Removing_a_Policy_Entry"><a class="permalink" href="#Removing_a_Policy_Entry">Removing
  a Policy Entry</a></h2>
To delete a policy entry from the policy file, select the line for that entry in
  the main &quot;Policy Tool&quot; window, then select the Remove Policy Entry
  button.
<p class="Pp">The complete policy entry is displayed, and you can then either
    select OK to remove the entry, or Cancel to keep it.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Saving_the_Policy_File"><a class="permalink" href="#Saving_the_Policy_File">Saving
  the Policy File</a></h2>
To save changes to an existing policy file, simply select the Save command in
  the File menu.
<p class="Pp">To save a new policy file you've been creating, or to copy an
    existing policy file to a new policy file with a different name, select the
    Save As command from the File menu. This brings up the Save As dialog
  box.</p>
<p class="Pp">Navigate the directory structure to get to the directory in which
    you want to save the policy file. Type the desired file name, then select
    the OK button. The policy file is now saved, and its name and path are shown
    in the text box labeled &quot;Policy File:&quot;</p>

</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Viewing_the_Warning_Log"><a class="permalink" href="#Viewing_the_Warning_Log">Viewing
  the Warning Log</a></h2>
If Policy Tool ever reports that warnings have been stored in the Warning Log,
  you can view the log by selecting the View Warning Log command in the Edit
  menu.
<p class="Pp">For example, if you have a policy file with a Keystore URL
    specifying a keystore that doesn't yet exist, you will get such a warning at
    various times, e.g., when you open the file. You can continue to work on the
    policy file even if warnings exist.</p>
