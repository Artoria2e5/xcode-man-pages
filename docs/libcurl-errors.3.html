libcurl-errors - error codes in libcurl
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This man page includes most, if not all, available error codes in libcurl. Why
  they occur and possibly what you can do to fix the problem are also included.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CURLcode"><a class="permalink" href="#CURLcode">CURLcode</a></h1>
Almost all &quot;easy&quot; interface functions return a CURLcode error code. No
  matter what, using the <i>curl_easy_setopt(3)</i> option
  <i>CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER(3)</i> is a good idea as it will give you a human
  readable error string that may offer more details about the cause of the error
  than just the error code. <i>curl_easy_strerror(3)</i> can be called to get an
  error string from a given CURLcode number.
<p class="Pp">CURLcode is one of the following:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>CURLE_OK (0)</dt>
  <dd>All fine. Proceed as usual.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL (1)</dt>
  <dd>The URL you passed to libcurl used a protocol that this libcurl does not
      support. The support might be a compile-time option that you didn't use,
      it can be a misspelled protocol string or just a protocol libcurl has no
      code for.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_FAILED_INIT (2)</dt>
  <dd>Very early initialization code failed. This is likely to be an internal
      error or problem, or a resource problem where something fundamental
      couldn't get done at init time.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_URL_MALFORMAT (3)</dt>
  <dd>The URL was not properly formatted.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_NOT_BUILT_IN (4)</dt>
  <dd>A requested feature, protocol or option was not found built-in in this
      libcurl due to a build-time decision. This means that a feature or option
      was not enabled or explicitly disabled when libcurl was built and in order
      to get it to function you have to get a rebuilt libcurl.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_COULDNT_RESOLVE_PROXY (5)</dt>
  <dd>Couldn't resolve proxy. The given proxy host could not be resolved.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_COULDNT_RESOLVE_HOST (6)</dt>
  <dd>Couldn't resolve host. The given remote host was not resolved.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_COULDNT_CONNECT (7)</dt>
  <dd>Failed to connect() to host or proxy.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_WEIRD_SERVER_REPLY (8)</dt>
  <dd>The server sent data libcurl couldn't parse. This error code was known as
      as <i>CURLE_FTP_WEIRD_SERVER_REPLY</i> before 7.51.0.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_REMOTE_ACCESS_DENIED (9)</dt>
  <dd>We were denied access to the resource given in the URL. For FTP, this
      occurs while trying to change to the remote directory.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_FTP_ACCEPT_FAILED (10)</dt>
  <dd>While waiting for the server to connect back when an active FTP session is
      used, an error code was sent over the control connection or similar.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_FTP_WEIRD_PASS_REPLY (11)</dt>
  <dd>After having sent the FTP password to the server, libcurl expects a proper
      reply. This error code indicates that an unexpected code was
    returned.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_FTP_ACCEPT_TIMEOUT (12)</dt>
  <dd>During an active FTP session while waiting for the server to connect, the
      <i>CURLOPT_ACCEPTTIMEOUT_MS(3)</i> (or the internal default) timeout
      expired.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_FTP_WEIRD_PASV_REPLY (13)</dt>
  <dd>libcurl failed to get a sensible result back from the server as a response
      to either a PASV or a EPSV command. The server is flawed.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_FTP_WEIRD_227_FORMAT (14)</dt>
  <dd>FTP servers return a 227-line as a response to a PASV command. If libcurl
      fails to parse that line, this return code is passed back.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_FTP_CANT_GET_HOST (15)</dt>
  <dd>An internal failure to lookup the host used for the new connection.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_HTTP2 (16)</dt>
  <dd>A problem was detected in the HTTP2 framing layer. This is somewhat
      generic and can be one out of several problems, see the error buffer for
      details.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_SET_TYPE (17)</dt>
  <dd>Received an error when trying to set the transfer mode to binary or
    ASCII.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_PARTIAL_FILE (18)</dt>
  <dd>A file transfer was shorter or larger than expected. This happens when the
      server first reports an expected transfer size, and then delivers data
      that doesn't match the previously given size.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_RETR_FILE (19)</dt>
  <dd>This was either a weird reply to a 'RETR' command or a zero byte transfer
      complete.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_QUOTE_ERROR (21)</dt>
  <dd>When sending custom &quot;QUOTE&quot; commands to the remote server, one
      of the commands returned an error code that was 400 or higher (for FTP) or
      otherwise indicated unsuccessful completion of the command.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_HTTP_RETURNED_ERROR (22)</dt>
  <dd>This is returned if <i>CURLOPT_FAILONERROR(3)</i> is set TRUE and the HTTP
      server returns an error code that is &gt;= 400.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_WRITE_ERROR (23)</dt>
  <dd>An error occurred when writing received data to a local file, or an error
      was returned to libcurl from a write callback.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_UPLOAD_FAILED (25)</dt>
  <dd>Failed starting the upload. For FTP, the server typically denied the STOR
      command. The error buffer usually contains the server's explanation for
      this.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_READ_ERROR (26)</dt>
  <dd>There was a problem reading a local file or an error returned by the read
      callback.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY (27)</dt>
  <dd>A memory allocation request failed. This is serious badness and things are
      severely screwed up if this ever occurs.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_OPERATION_TIMEDOUT (28)</dt>
  <dd>Operation timeout. The specified time-out period was reached according to
      the conditions.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_FTP_PORT_FAILED (30)</dt>
  <dd>The FTP PORT command returned error. This mostly happens when you haven't
      specified a good enough address for libcurl to use. See
      <i>CURLOPT_FTPPORT(3)</i>.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_USE_REST (31)</dt>
  <dd>The FTP REST command returned error. This should never happen if the
      server is sane.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_RANGE_ERROR (33)</dt>
  <dd>The server does not support or accept range requests.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_HTTP_POST_ERROR (34)</dt>
  <dd>This is an odd error that mainly occurs due to internal confusion.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_SSL_CONNECT_ERROR (35)</dt>
  <dd>A problem occurred somewhere in the SSL/TLS handshake. You really want the
      error buffer and read the message there as it pinpoints the problem
      slightly more. Could be certificates (file formats, paths, permissions),
      passwords, and others.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_BAD_DOWNLOAD_RESUME (36)</dt>
  <dd>The download could not be resumed because the specified offset was out of
      the file boundary.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_FILE_COULDNT_READ_FILE (37)</dt>
  <dd>A file given with FILE:// couldn't be opened. Most likely because the file
      path doesn't identify an existing file. Did you check file
    permissions?</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_LDAP_CANNOT_BIND (38)</dt>
  <dd>LDAP cannot bind. LDAP bind operation failed.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_LDAP_SEARCH_FAILED (39)</dt>
  <dd>LDAP search failed.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_FUNCTION_NOT_FOUND (41)</dt>
  <dd>Function not found. A required zlib function was not found.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_ABORTED_BY_CALLBACK (42)</dt>
  <dd>Aborted by callback. A callback returned &quot;abort&quot; to
    libcurl.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_BAD_FUNCTION_ARGUMENT (43)</dt>
  <dd>A function was called with a bad parameter.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_INTERFACE_FAILED (45)</dt>
  <dd>Interface error. A specified outgoing interface could not be used. Set
      which interface to use for outgoing connections' source IP address with
      <i>CURLOPT_INTERFACE(3)</i>.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS (47)</dt>
  <dd>Too many redirects. When following redirects, libcurl hit the maximum
      amount. Set your limit with <i>CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS(3)</i>.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION (48)</dt>
  <dd>An option passed to libcurl is not recognized/known. Refer to the
      appropriate documentation. This is most likely a problem in the program
      that uses libcurl. The error buffer might contain more specific
      information about which exact option it concerns.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_TELNET_OPTION_SYNTAX (49)</dt>
  <dd>A telnet option string was Illegally formatted.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_GOT_NOTHING (52)</dt>
  <dd>Nothing was returned from the server, and under the circumstances, getting
      nothing is considered an error.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_SSL_ENGINE_NOTFOUND (53)</dt>
  <dd>The specified crypto engine wasn't found.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_SSL_ENGINE_SETFAILED (54)</dt>
  <dd>Failed setting the selected SSL crypto engine as default!</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_SEND_ERROR (55)</dt>
  <dd>Failed sending network data.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_RECV_ERROR (56)</dt>
  <dd>Failure with receiving network data.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_SSL_CERTPROBLEM (58)</dt>
  <dd>problem with the local client certificate.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_SSL_CIPHER (59)</dt>
  <dd>Couldn't use specified cipher.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_PEER_FAILED_VERIFICATION (60)</dt>
  <dd>The remote server's SSL certificate or SSH md5 fingerprint was deemed not
      OK. This error code has been unified with CURLE_SSL_CACERT since 7.62.0.
      Its previous value was 51.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_BAD_CONTENT_ENCODING (61)</dt>
  <dd>Unrecognized transfer encoding.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_LDAP_INVALID_URL (62)</dt>
  <dd>Invalid LDAP URL.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_FILESIZE_EXCEEDED (63)</dt>
  <dd>Maximum file size exceeded.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_USE_SSL_FAILED (64)</dt>
  <dd>Requested FTP SSL level failed.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_SEND_FAIL_REWIND (65)</dt>
  <dd>When doing a send operation curl had to rewind the data to retransmit, but
      the rewinding operation failed.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_SSL_ENGINE_INITFAILED (66)</dt>
  <dd>Initiating the SSL Engine failed.</dd>

  <dt>CURLE_REMOTE_FILE_EXISTS (73)</dt>
  <dd>File already exists and will not be overwritten.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_TFTP_NOSUCHUSER (74)</dt>
  <dd>This error should never be returned by a properly functioning TFTP
    server.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_CONV_FAILED (75)</dt>
  <dd>Character conversion failed.</dd>
  <dt>CURLE_CONV_REQD (76)</dt>
  <dd>Caller must register conversion callbacks.</dd>

  <dd>The FTP server does not understand the PRET command at all or does not
      support the given argument. Be careful when using
      <i>CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST(3)</i>, a custom LIST command will be sent with
      PRET CMD before PASV as well. (Added in 7.20.0)</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM (-1)</dt>
