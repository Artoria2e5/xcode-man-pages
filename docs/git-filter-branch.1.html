Lets you rewrite Git revision history by rewriting the branches mentioned in the
  &lt;rev-list options&gt;, applying custom filters on each revision. Those
  filters can modify each tree (e.g. removing a file or running a perl rewrite
  on all files) or information about each commit. Otherwise, all information
  (including original commit times or merge information) will be preserved.
<p class="Pp">The command will only rewrite the <i>positive</i> refs mentioned
    in the command line (e.g. if you pass <i>a..b</i>, only <i>b</i> will be
    rewritten). If you specify no filters, the commits will be recommitted
    without any changes, which would normally have no effect. Nevertheless, this
    may be useful in the future for compensating for some Git bugs or such,
    therefore such a usage is permitted.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE</b>: This command honors <b>.git/info/grafts</b> file and
    refs in the <b>refs/replace/</b> namespace. If you have any grafts or
    replacement refs defined, running this command will make them permanent.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>WARNING</b>! The rewritten history will have different object
    names for all the objects and will not converge with the original branch.
    You will not be able to easily push and distribute the rewritten branch on
    top of the original branch. Please do not use this command if you do not
    know the full implications, and avoid using it anyway, if a simple single
    commit would suffice to fix your problem. (See the &quot;RECOVERING FROM
    UPSTREAM REBASE&quot; section in <b>git-rebase</b>(1) for further
    information about rewriting published history.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Always verify that the rewritten version is correct: The original
    refs, if different from the rewritten ones, will be stored in the namespace
    <i>refs/original/</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that since this operation is very I/O expensive, it might be
    a good idea to redirect the temporary directory off-disk with the <b>-d</b>
    option, e.g. on tmpfs. Reportedly the speedup is very noticeable.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Filters"><a class="permalink" href="#Filters">Filters</a></h2>
The filters are applied in the order as listed below. The &lt;command&gt;
  argument is always evaluated in the shell context using the <i>eval</i>
  command (with the notable exception of the commit filter, for technical
  reasons). Prior to that, the <b>$GIT_COMMIT</b> environment variable will be
  set to contain the id of the commit being rewritten. Also, GIT_AUTHOR_NAME,
  GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL, GIT_AUTHOR_DATE, GIT_COMMITTER_NAME, GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL,
  and GIT_COMMITTER_DATE are taken from the current commit and exported to the
  environment, in order to affect the author and committer identities of the
  replacement commit created by <b>git-commit-tree</b>(1) after the filters have
  run.
<p class="Pp">If any evaluation of &lt;command&gt; returns a non-zero exit
    status, the whole operation will be aborted.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <i>map</i> function is available that takes an &quot;original
    sha1 id&quot; argument and outputs a &quot;rewritten sha1 id&quot; if the
    commit has been already rewritten, and &quot;original sha1 id&quot;
    otherwise; the <i>map</i> function can return several ids on separate lines
    if your commit filter emitted multiple commits.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
--setup &lt;command&gt;
<div class="Bd-indent">This is not a real filter executed for each commit but a
  one time setup just before the loop. Therefore no commit-specific variables
  are defined yet. Functions or variables defined here can be used or modified
  in the following filter steps except the commit filter, for technical
  reasons.</div>
<p class="Pp">--subdirectory-filter &lt;directory&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Only look at the history which touches the given
  subdirectory. The result will contain that directory (and only that) as its
  project root. Implies the section called &#x201C;Remap to
  ancestor&#x201D;.</div>
<p class="Pp">--env-filter &lt;command&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This filter may be used if you only need to modify the
  environment in which the commit will be performed. Specifically, you might
  want to rewrite the author/committer name/email/time environment variables
  (see <b>git-commit-tree</b>(1) for details).</div>
<p class="Pp">--tree-filter &lt;command&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is the filter for rewriting the tree and its
  contents. The argument is evaluated in shell with the working directory set to
  the root of the checked out tree. The new tree is then used as-is (new files
  are auto-added, disappeared files are auto-removed - neither .gitignore files
  nor any other ignore rules <b>HAVE ANY EFFECT</b>!).</div>
<p class="Pp">--index-filter &lt;command&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is the filter for rewriting the index. It is similar
  to the tree filter but does not check out the tree, which makes it much
  faster. Frequently used with <b>git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch ...</b>, see
  EXAMPLES below. For hairy cases, see <b>git-update-index</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">--parent-filter &lt;command&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is the filter for rewriting the commit&#x2019;s
  parent list. It will receive the parent string on stdin and shall output the
  new parent string on stdout. The parent string is in the format described in
  <b>git-commit-tree</b>(1): empty for the initial commit, &quot;-p parent&quot;
  for a normal commit and &quot;-p parent1 -p parent2 -p parent3 ...&quot; for a
  merge commit.</div>
<p class="Pp">--msg-filter &lt;command&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is the filter for rewriting the commit messages. The
  argument is evaluated in the shell with the original commit message on
  standard input; its standard output is used as the new commit message.</div>
<p class="Pp">--commit-filter &lt;command&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is the filter for performing the commit. If this
  filter is specified, it will be called instead of the <i>git commit-tree</i>
  command, with arguments of the form &quot;&lt;TREE_ID&gt; [(-p
  &lt;PARENT_COMMIT_ID&gt;)...]&quot; and the log message on stdin. The commit
  id is expected on stdout.
<p class="Pp">As a special extension, the commit filter may emit multiple commit
    ids; in that case, the rewritten children of the original commit will have
    all of them as parents.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can use the <i>map</i> convenience function in this filter,
    and other convenience functions, too. For example, calling <i>skip_commit
    &quot;$@&quot;</i> will leave out the current commit (but not its changes!
    If you want that, use <i>git rebase</i> instead).</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also use the <b>git_commit_non_empty_tree
    &quot;$@&quot;</b> instead of <b>git commit-tree &quot;$@&quot;</b> if you
    don&#x2019;t wish to keep commits with a single parent and that makes no
    change to the tree.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--tag-name-filter &lt;command&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is the filter for rewriting tag names. When passed,
  it will be called for every tag ref that points to a rewritten object (or to a
  tag object which points to a rewritten object). The original tag name is
  passed via standard input, and the new tag name is expected on standard
  output.
<p class="Pp">The original tags are not deleted, but can be overwritten; use
    &quot;--tag-name-filter cat&quot; to simply update the tags. In this case,
    be very careful and make sure you have the old tags backed up in case the
    conversion has run afoul.</p>
<p class="Pp">Nearly proper rewriting of tag objects is supported. If the tag
    has a message attached, a new tag object will be created with the same
    message, author, and timestamp. If the tag has a signature attached, the
    signature will be stripped. It is by definition impossible to preserve
    signatures. The reason this is &quot;nearly&quot; proper, is because ideally
    if the tag did not change (points to the same object, has the same name,
    etc.) it should retain any signature. That is not the case, signatures will
    always be removed, buyer beware. There is also no support for changing the
    author or timestamp (or the tag message for that matter). Tags which point
    to other tags will be rewritten to point to the underlying commit.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--prune-empty</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Some filters will generate empty commits that leave the
  tree untouched. This option instructs git-filter-branch to remove such commits
  if they have exactly one or zero non-pruned parents; merge commits will
  therefore remain intact. This option cannot be used together with
  <b>--commit-filter</b>, though the same effect can be achieved by using the
  provided <b>git_commit_non_empty_tree</b> function in a commit filter.</div>
<p class="Pp">--original &lt;namespace&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use this option to set the namespace where the original
  commits will be stored. The default value is <i>refs/original</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-d &lt;directory&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use this option to set the path to the temporary
  directory used for rewriting. When applying a tree filter, the command needs
  to temporarily check out the tree to some directory, which may consume
  considerable space in case of large projects. By default it does this in the
  <i>.git-rewrite/</i> directory but you can override that choice by this
  parameter.</div>
<p class="Pp">-f, --force</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><i>git filter-branch</i> refuses to start with an
  existing temporary directory or when there are already refs starting with
  <i>refs/original/</i>, unless forced.</div>
<p class="Pp">--state-branch &lt;branch&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option will cause the mapping from old to new
  objects to be loaded from named branch upon startup and saved as a new commit
  to that branch upon exit, enabling incremental of large trees. If
  <i>&lt;branch&gt;</i> does not exist it will be created.</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;rev-list options&gt;...</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Arguments for <i>git rev-list</i>. All positive refs
  included by these options are rewritten. You may also specify options such as
  <b>--all</b>, but you must use <b>--</b> to separate them from the <i>git
  filter-branch</i> options. Implies the section called &#x201C;Remap to
  ancestor&#x201D;.</div>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Remap_to_ancestor"><a class="permalink" href="#Remap_to_ancestor">Remap
  to ancestor</a></h2>
By using <b>git-rev-list</b>(1) arguments, e.g., path limiters, you can limit
  the set of revisions which get rewritten. However, positive refs on the
  command line are distinguished: we don&#x2019;t let them be excluded by such
  limiters. For this purpose, they are instead rewritten to point at the nearest
  ancestor that was not excluded.

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EXIT_STATUS"><a class="permalink" href="#EXIT_STATUS">EXIT
  STATUS</a></h1>
On success, the exit status is <b>0</b>. If the filter can&#x2019;t find any
  commits to rewrite, the exit status is <b>2</b>. On any other error, the exit
  status may be any other non-zero value.

Suppose you want to remove a file (containing confidential information or
  copyright violation) from all commits:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm filename' HEAD
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">However, if the file is absent from the tree of some commit, a
    simple <b>rm filename</b> will fail for that tree and commit. Thus you may
    instead want to use <b>rm -f filename</b> as the script.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using <b>--index-filter</b> with <i>git rm</i> yields a
    significantly faster version. Like with using <b>rm filename</b>, <b>git rm
    --cached filename</b> will fail if the file is absent from the tree of a
    commit. If you want to &quot;completely forget&quot; a file, it does not
    matter when it entered history, so we also add <b>--ignore-unmatch</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch filename' HEAD
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Now, you will get the rewritten history saved in HEAD.</p>
<p class="Pp">To rewrite the repository to look as if <b>foodir/</b> had been
    its project root, and discard all other history:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter foodir -- --all
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Thus you can, e.g., turn a library subdirectory into a repository
    of its own. Note the <b>--</b> that separates <i>filter-branch</i> options
    from revision options, and the <b>--all</b> to rewrite all branches and
    tags.</p>
<p class="Pp">To set a commit (which typically is at the tip of another history)
    to be the parent of the current initial commit, in order to paste the other
    history behind the current history:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch --parent-filter 'sed &quot;s/^\$/-p &lt;graft-id&gt;/&quot;' HEAD
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">(if the parent string is empty - which happens when we are dealing
    with the initial commit - add graftcommit as a parent). Note that this
    assumes history with a single root (that is, no merge without common
    ancestors happened). If this is not the case, use:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch --parent-filter \
        'test $GIT_COMMIT = &lt;commit-id&gt; &amp;&amp; echo &quot;-p &lt;graft-id&gt;&quot; || cat' HEAD
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">or even simpler:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git replace --graft $commit-id $graft-id
git filter-branch $graft-id..HEAD
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">To remove commits authored by &quot;Darl McBribe&quot; from the
    history:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch --commit-filter '
        if [ &quot;$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME&quot; = &quot;Darl McBribe&quot; ];
        then
                skip_commit &quot;$@&quot;;
        else
                git commit-tree &quot;$@&quot;;
        fi' HEAD
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The function <i>skip_commit</i> is defined as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
skip_commit()
{
        shift;
        while [ -n &quot;$1&quot; ];
        do
                shift;
                map &quot;$1&quot;;
                shift;
        done;
}
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The shift magic first throws away the tree id and then the -p
    parameters. Note that this handles merges properly! In case Darl committed a
    merge between P1 and P2, it will be propagated properly and all children of
    the merge will become merge commits with P1,P2 as their parents instead of
    the merge commit.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE</b> the changes introduced by the commits, and which are
    not reverted by subsequent commits, will still be in the rewritten branch.
    If you want to throw out <i>changes</i> together with the commits, you
    should use the interactive mode of <i>git rebase</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can rewrite the commit log messages using <b>--msg-filter</b>.
    For example, <i>git svn-id</i> strings in a repository created by <i>git
    svn</i> can be removed this way:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch --msg-filter '
        sed -e &quot;/^git-svn-id:/d&quot;
'
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">If you need to add <i>Acked-by</i> lines to, say, the last 10
    commits (none of which is a merge), use this command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch --msg-filter '
        cat &amp;&amp;
        echo &quot;Acked-by: Bugs Bunny &lt;bunny@bugzilla.org&gt;&quot;
' HEAD~10..HEAD
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>--env-filter</b> option can be used to modify committer
    and/or author identity. For example, if you found out that your commits have
    the wrong identity due to a misconfigured user.email, you can make a
    correction, before publishing the project, like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch --env-filter '
        if test &quot;$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL&quot; = &quot;root@localhost&quot;
        then
                GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=john@example.com
        fi
        if test &quot;$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL&quot; = &quot;root@localhost&quot;
        then
                GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=john@example.com
        fi
' -- --all
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">To restrict rewriting to only part of the history, specify a
    revision range in addition to the new branch name. The new branch name will
    point to the top-most revision that a <i>git rev-list</i> of this range will
    print.</p>
<p class="Pp">Consider this history:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
     D--E--F--G--H
    /     /
A--B-----C
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">To rewrite only commits D,E,F,G,H, but leave A, B and C alone,
    use:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch ... C..H
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">To rewrite commits E,F,G,H, use one of these:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch ... C..H --not D
git filter-branch ... D..H --not C
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">To move the whole tree into a subdirectory, or remove it from
    there:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git filter-branch --index-filter \
        'git ls-files -s | sed &quot;s-\t\&quot;*-&amp;newsubdir/-&quot; |
                GIT_INDEX_FILE=$GIT_INDEX_FILE.new \
                        git update-index --index-info &amp;&amp;
         mv &quot;$GIT_INDEX_FILE.new&quot; &quot;$GIT_INDEX_FILE&quot;' HEAD

git-filter-branch can be used to get rid of a subset of files, usually with some
  combination of <b>--index-filter</b> and <b>--subdirectory-filter</b>. People
  expect the resulting repository to be smaller than the original, but you need
  a few more steps to actually make it smaller, because Git tries hard not to
  lose your objects until you tell it to. First make sure that:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;You really removed all variants of a filename, if
  a blob was moved over its lifetime. <b>git log --name-only --follow --all --
  filename</b> can help you find renames.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;You really filtered all refs: use
  <b>--tag-name-filter cat -- --all</b> when calling git-filter-branch.</div>
<p class="Pp">Then there are two ways to get a smaller repository. A safer way
    is to clone, that keeps your original intact.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Clone it with <b>git clone
  file:///path/to/repo</b>. The clone will not have the removed objects. See
  <b>git-clone</b>(1). (Note that cloning with a plain path just hardlinks
  everything!)</div>
<p class="Pp">If you really don&#x2019;t want to clone it, for whatever reasons,
    check the following points instead (in this order). This is a very
    destructive approach, so <b>make a backup</b> or go back to cloning it. You
    have been warned.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Remove the original refs backed up by
  git-filter-branch: say <b>git for-each-ref --format=&quot;%(refname)&quot;
  refs/original/ | xargs -n 1 git update-ref -d</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Expire all reflogs with <b>git reflog expire
  --expire=now --all</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Garbage collect all unreferenced objects with

git-filter-branch allows you to make complex shell-scripted rewrites of your Git
  history, but you probably don&#x2019;t need this flexibility if you&#x2019;re
  simply <i>removing unwanted data</i> like large files or passwords. For those
  operations you may want to consider <b>The BFG Repo-Cleaner</b>[1], a
  JVM-based alternative to git-filter-branch, typically at least 10-50x faster
  for those use-cases, and with quite different characteristics:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Any particular version of a file is cleaned
  exactly <i>once</i>. The BFG, unlike git-filter-branch, does not give you the
  opportunity to handle a file differently based on where or when it was
  committed within your history. This constraint gives the core performance
  benefit of The BFG, and is well-suited to the task of cleansing bad data - you
  don&#x2019;t care <i>where</i> the bad data is, you just want it
  <i>gone</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;By default The BFG takes full advantage of
