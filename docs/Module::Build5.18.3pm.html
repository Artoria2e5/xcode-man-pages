<pre>
  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test

<p class="Pp">Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't
    require the &quot;./&quot; notation, you can do this:</p>

<span class="Li">&quot;Module::Build&quot;</span> is a system for building,
  testing, and installing Perl modules. It is meant to be an alternative to
  <span class="Li">&quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot;</span>. Developers may alter
  the behavior of the module through subclassing in a much more straightforward
  way than with <span class="Li">&quot;MakeMaker&quot;</span>. It also does not
  require a <span class="Li">&quot;make&quot;</span> on your system - most of
  the <span class="Li">&quot;Module::Build&quot;</span> code is pure-perl and
  written in a very cross-platform way. In fact, you don't even need a shell, so
  even platforms like MacOS (traditional) can use it fairly easily. Its only
  prerequisites are modules that are included with perl 5.6.0, and it works fine
  on perl 5.005 if you can install a few additional modules.
<p class="Pp">See &quot;MOTIVATIONS&quot; for more comparisons between
    <span class="Li">&quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Module::Build&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">To install <span class="Li">&quot;Module::Build&quot;</span>, and
    any other module that uses <span class="Li">&quot;Module::Build&quot;</span>
    for its installation process, do the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  perl Build.PL       # 'Build.PL' script creates the 'Build' script
  ./Build             # Need ./ to ensure we're using this &quot;Build&quot; script
  ./Build test        # and not another one that happens to be in the PATH
  ./Build install
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This illustrates initial configuration and the running of three
    'actions'. In this case the actions run are 'build' (the default action),
    'test', and 'install'. Other actions defined so far include:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  build                          manifest
  clean                          manifest_skip
  code                           manpages
  config_data                    pardist
  diff                           ppd
  dist                           ppmdist
  distcheck                      prereq_data
  distclean                      prereq_report

  distsign                       skipcheck
  disttest                       test
  docs                           testall
  fakeinstall                    testcover

<h1 class="Sh" id="ACTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#ACTIONS">ACTIONS</a></h1>
There are some general principles at work here. First, each task when building a
  module is called an &quot;action&quot;. These actions are listed above; they
  correspond to the building, testing, installing, packaging, etc., tasks.
<p class="Pp">Second, arguments are processed in a very systematic way.
    Arguments are always key=value pairs. They may be specified at
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl Build.PL&quot;</span> time (i.e.
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl Build.PL destdir=/my/secret/place&quot;</span>),
    in which case their values last for the lifetime of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Build&quot;</span> script. They may also be specified
    when executing a particular action (i.e. <span class="Li">&quot;Build test
    verbose=1&quot;</span>), in which case their values last only for the
    lifetime of that command. Per-action command line parameters take precedence
    over parameters specified at <span class="Li">&quot;perl
    Build.PL&quot;</span> time.</p>
<p class="Pp">The build process also relies heavily on the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Config.pm&quot;</span> module. If the user wishes to
    override any of the values in <span class="Li">&quot;Config.pm&quot;</span>,
    she may specify them like so:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  perl Build.PL --config cc=gcc --config ld=gcc
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The following build actions are provided by default.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>build</dt>
  <dd>[version 0.01]
    <p class="Pp">If you run the <span class="Li">&quot;Build&quot;</span>
        script without any arguments, it runs the
        <span class="Li">&quot;build&quot;</span> action, which in turn runs the
        <span class="Li">&quot;code&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;docs&quot;</span> actions.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This is analogous to the
        <span class="Li">&quot;MakeMaker&quot;</span> <i>make all</i>
      target.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>clean</dt>
  <dd>[version 0.01]
    <p class="Pp">This action will clean up any files that the build process may
        have created, including the <span class="Li">&quot;blib/&quot;</span>
        directory (but not including the
        <span class="Li">&quot;_build/&quot;</span> directory and the
        <span class="Li">&quot;Build&quot;</span> script itself).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>code</dt>
  <dd>[version 0.20]
    <p class="Pp">This action builds your code base.</p>
    <p class="Pp">By default it just creates a
        <span class="Li">&quot;blib/&quot;</span> directory and copies any
        <span class="Li">&quot;.pm&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;.pod&quot;</span> files from your
        <span class="Li">&quot;lib/&quot;</span> directory into the
        <span class="Li">&quot;blib/&quot;</span> directory. It also compiles
        any <span class="Li">&quot;.xs&quot;</span> files from
        <span class="Li">&quot;lib/&quot;</span> and places them in
        <span class="Li">&quot;blib/&quot;</span>. Of course, you need a working
        C compiler (probably the same one that built perl itself) for the
        compilation to work properly.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;code&quot;</span> action also runs
        any <span class="Li">&quot;.PL&quot;</span> files in your <i>lib/</i>
        directory. Typically these create other files, named the same but
        without the <span class="Li">&quot;.PL&quot;</span> ending. For example,
        a file <i>lib/Foo/Bar.pm.PL</i> could create the file
        <i>lib/Foo/Bar.pm</i>. The <span class="Li">&quot;.PL&quot;</span> files
        are processed first, so any <span class="Li">&quot;.pm&quot;</span>
        files (or other kinds that we deal with) will get copied correctly.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>config_data</dt>
  <dd>[version 0.26]
    <p class="Pp">...</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>diff</dt>
  <dd>[version 0.14]
    <p class="Pp">This action will compare the files about to be installed with
        their installed counterparts. For .pm and .pod files, a diff will be
        shown (this currently requires a 'diff' program to be in your PATH). For
        other files like compiled binary files, we simply report whether they
        differ.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A <span class="Li">&quot;flags&quot;</span> parameter may be
        passed to the action, which will be passed to the 'diff' program.
        Consult your 'diff' documentation for the parameters it will accept - a
        good one is <span class="Li">&quot;-u&quot;</span>:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  ./Build diff flags=-u
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>dist</dt>
  <dd>[version 0.02]
    <p class="Pp">This action is helpful for module authors who want to package
        up their module for source distribution through a medium like CPAN. It
        will create a tarball of the files listed in <i>MANIFEST</i> and
        compress the tarball using GZIP compression.</p>
    <p class="Pp">By default, this action will use the
        <span class="Li">&quot;Archive::Tar&quot;</span> module. However, you
        can force it to use binary &quot;tar&quot; and &quot;gzip&quot;
        executables by supplying an explicit
        <span class="Li">&quot;tar&quot;</span> (and optional
        <span class="Li">&quot;gzip&quot;</span>) parameter:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  ./Build dist --tar C:\path\to\tar.exe --gzip C:\path\to\zip.exe
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>distcheck</dt>
  <dd>[version 0.05]
    <p class="Pp">Reports which files are in the build directory but not in the
        <i>MANIFEST</i> file, and vice versa. (See manifest for details.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>distclean</dt>
  <dd>[version 0.05]
    <p class="Pp">Performs the 'realclean' action and then the 'distcheck'
        action.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>distdir</dt>
  <dd>[version 0.05]
    <p class="Pp">Creates a &quot;distribution directory&quot; named
        <span class="Li">&quot;$dist_name-$dist_version&quot;</span> (if that
        directory already exists, it will be removed first), then copies all the
        files listed in the <i>MANIFEST</i> file to that directory. This
        directory is what the distribution tarball is created from.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>distinstall</dt>
  <dd>[version 0.37]
    <p class="Pp">Performs the 'distdir' action, then switches into that
        directory and runs a <span class="Li">&quot;perl Build.PL&quot;</span>,
        followed by the 'build' and 'install' actions in that directory. Use
        PERL_MB_OPT or <i>.modulebuildrc</i> to set options that should be
        applied during subprocesses</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>distmeta</dt>
  <dd>[version 0.21]
    <p class="Pp">Creates the <i>META.yml</i> file that describes the
        distribution.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><i>META.yml</i> is a file containing various bits of
        <i>metadata</i> about the distribution. The metadata includes the
        distribution name, version, abstract, prerequisites, license, and
        various other data about the distribution. This file is created as
        <i>META.yml</i> in a simplified YAML format.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><i>META.yml</i> file must also be listed in <i>MANIFEST</i> -
        if it's not, a warning will be issued.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The current version of the <i>META.yml</i> specification can
        be found on CPAN as CPAN::Meta::Spec.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>distsign</dt>
  <dd>[version 0.16]
    <p class="Pp">Uses <span class="Li">&quot;Module::Signature&quot;</span> to
        create a SIGNATURE file for your distribution, and adds the SIGNATURE
        file to the distribution's MANIFEST.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>disttest</dt>
  <dd>[version 0.05]
    <p class="Pp">Performs the 'distdir' action, then switches into that
        directory and runs a <span class="Li">&quot;perl Build.PL&quot;</span>,
        followed by the 'build' and 'test' actions in that directory. Use
        PERL_MB_OPT or <i>.modulebuildrc</i> to set options that should be
        applied during subprocesses</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>docs</dt>
  <dd>[version 0.20]
    <p class="Pp">This will generate documentation (e.g. Unix man pages and HTML
        documents) for any installable items under <b>blib/</b> that contain
        POD. If there are no <span class="Li">&quot;bindoc&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;libdoc&quot;</span> installation targets defined
        (as will be the case on systems that don't support Unix manpages) no
        action is taken for manpages. If there are no
        <span class="Li">&quot;binhtml&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;libhtml&quot;</span> installation targets defined
        no action is taken for HTML documents.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>fakeinstall</dt>
  <dd>[version 0.02]
    <p class="Pp">This is just like the
        <span class="Li">&quot;install&quot;</span> action, but it won't
        actually do anything, it will just report what it <i>would</i> have done
        if you had actually run the <span class="Li">&quot;install&quot;</span>
        action.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>help</dt>
  <dd>[version 0.03]
    <p class="Pp">This action will simply print out a message that is meant to
        help you use the build process. It will show you a list of available
        build actions too.</p>
    <p class="Pp">With an optional argument specifying an action name (e.g.
        <span class="Li">&quot;Build help</span>
        <span class="Li">test&quot;</span>), the 'help' action will show you any
        POD documentation it can find for that action.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>html</dt>
  <dd>[version 0.26]
    <p class="Pp">This will generate HTML documentation for any binary or
        library files under <b>blib/</b> that contain POD. The HTML
        documentation will only be installed if the install paths can be
        determined from values in <span class="Li">&quot;Config.pm&quot;</span>.
        You can also supply or override install paths on the command line by
        specifying <span class="Li">&quot;install_path&quot;</span> values for
        the <span class="Li">&quot;binhtml&quot;</span> and/or
        <span class="Li">&quot;libhtml&quot;</span> installation targets.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>install</dt>
  <dd>[version 0.01]
    <p class="Pp">This action will use
        <span class="Li">&quot;ExtUtils::Install&quot;</span> to install the
        files from <span class="Li">&quot;blib/&quot;</span> into the system.
        See &quot;INSTALL PATHS&quot; for details about how Module::Build
        determines where to install things, and how to influence this
      process.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you want the installation process to look around in
        <span class="Li">@INC</span> for other versions of the stuff you're
        installing and try to delete it, you can use the
        <span class="Li">&quot;uninst&quot;</span> parameter, which tells
        <span class="Li">&quot;ExtUtils::Install&quot;</span> to do so:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  ./Build install uninst=1
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This can be a good idea, as it helps prevent multiple versions
        of a module from being present on your system, which can be a confusing
        situation indeed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>installdeps</dt>
  <dd>[version 0.36]
    <p class="Pp">This action will use the
        <span class="Li">&quot;cpan_client&quot;</span> parameter as a command
        to install missing prerequisites. You will be prompted whether to
        install optional dependencies.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;cpan_client&quot;</span> option
        defaults to 'cpan' but can be set as an option or in
        <i>.modulebuildrc</i>. It must be a shell command that takes a list of
        modules to install as arguments (e.g. 'cpanp -i' for CPANPLUS). If the
        program part is a relative path (e.g. 'cpan' or 'cpanp'), it will be
        located relative to the perl program that executed Build.PL.</p>

  ./Build installdeps --cpan_client 'cpanp -i'
  # installs to 5.8.9
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>manifest</dt>
  <dd>[version 0.05]
    <p class="Pp">This is an action intended for use by module authors, not
        people installing modules. It will bring the <i>MANIFEST</i> up to date
        with the files currently present in the distribution. You may use a
        <i>MANIFEST.SKIP</i> file to exclude certain files or directories from
        inclusion in the <i>MANIFEST</i>. <i>MANIFEST.SKIP</i> should contain a
        bunch of regular expressions, one per line. If a file in the
        distribution directory matches any of the regular expressions, it won't
        be included in the <i>MANIFEST</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The following is a reasonable <i>MANIFEST.SKIP</i> starting

    <p class="Pp">If you want to run tests under the perl debugger, pass the
        argument <span class="Li">&quot;debugger=1&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you want to have Module::Build find test files with
        different file name extensions, pass the

        array of extensions, such as <span class="Li">&quot;[qw( .t .s .z

    <p class="Pp">If you want test to be run by

        <span class="Li">&quot;tap_harness_args&quot;</span> as an array
        reference of arguments to pass to the TAP::Harness constructor.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In addition, if a file called
        <span class="Li">&quot;visual.pl&quot;</span> exists in the top-level
        directory, this file will be executed as a Perl script and its output
        will be shown to the user. This is a good place to put speed tests or
        other tests that don't use the
        <span class="Li">&quot;Test::Harness&quot;</span> format for output.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To override the choice of tests to run, you may pass a
        <span class="Li">&quot;test_files&quot;</span> argument whose value is a
        whitespace-separated list of test scripts to run. This is especially
        useful in development, when you only want to run a single test to see

<p class="Pp">When Module::Build starts up, it will look first for a file,

<p class="Pp">Besides the regular actions, there are two special pseudo-actions:
    the key <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> (asterisk) denotes any global

[version 0.19]
<p class="Pp">When you invoke Module::Build's
    <span class="Li">&quot;build&quot;</span> action, it needs to figure out
    where to install things. The nutshell version of how this works is that
    default installation locations are determined from <i>Config.pm</i>, and
    they may be overridden by using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;install_path&quot;</span> parameter. An
    <span class="Li">&quot;install_base&quot;</span> parameter lets you specify
    an alternative installation root like <i>/home/foo</i>, and a
    <span class="Li">&quot;destdir&quot;</span> lets you specify a temporary
    installation directory like <i>/tmp/install</i> in case you want to create
    bundled-up installable packages.</p>
<p class="Pp">Natively, Module::Build provides default installation locations
    for the following types of installable items:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>lib</dt>
  <dd>Usually pure-Perl module files ending in <i>.pm</i>.</dd>
  <dt>arch</dt>
  <dd>&quot;Architecture-dependent&quot; module files, usually produced by
      compiling XS, Inline, or similar code.</dd>
  <dt>script</dt>
  <dd>Programs written in pure Perl. In order to improve reuse, try to make
      these as small as possible - put the code into modules whenever
    possible.</dd>
  <dt>bin</dt>
  <dd>&quot;Architecture-dependent&quot; executable programs, i.e. compiled C
      code or something. Pretty rare to see this in a perl distribution, but it
      happens.</dd>
  <dt>bindoc</dt>
  <dd>Documentation for the stuff in <span class="Li">&quot;script&quot;</span>
      and <span class="Li">&quot;bin&quot;</span>. Usually generated from the
      POD in those files. Under Unix, these are manual pages belonging to the
      'man1' category.</dd>
  <dt>libdoc</dt>
  <dd>Documentation for the stuff in <span class="Li">&quot;lib&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;arch&quot;</span>. This is usually generated from
      the POD in <i>.pm</i> files. Under Unix, these are manual pages belonging
      to the 'man3' category.</dd>
  <dt>binhtml</dt>
  <dd>This is the same as <span class="Li">&quot;bindoc&quot;</span> above, but
      applies to HTML documents.</dd>
  <dt>libhtml</dt>
  <dd>This is the same as <span class="Li">&quot;libdoc&quot;</span> above, but
      applies to HTML documents.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Four other parameters let you control various aspects of how
    installation paths are determined:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>installdirs</dt>
  <dd>The default destinations for these installable things come from entries in
      your system's <span class="Li">&quot;Config.pm&quot;</span>. You can
      select from three different sets of default locations by setting the
      <span class="Li">&quot;installdirs&quot;</span> parameter as follows:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
                          'installdirs' set to:
                   core          site                vendor

              uses the following defaults from Config.pm:

  lib     =&gt; installprivlib  installsitelib      installvendorlib
  arch    =&gt; installarchlib  installsitearch     installvendorarch
  script  =&gt; installscript   installsitescript   installvendorscript
  bin     =&gt; installbin      installsitebin      installvendorbin
  bindoc  =&gt; installman1dir  installsiteman1dir  installvendorman1dir
  libdoc  =&gt; installman3dir  installsiteman3dir  installvendorman3dir
  binhtml =&gt; installhtml1dir installsitehtml1dir installvendorhtml1dir [*]
  libhtml =&gt; installhtml3dir installsitehtml3dir installvendorhtml3dir [*]

  * Under some OS (eg. MSWin32) the destination for HTML documents is
    determined by the C&lt;Config.pm&gt; entry C&lt;installhtmldir&gt;.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The default value of
        <span class="Li">&quot;installdirs&quot;</span> is &quot;site&quot;. If
        you're creating vendor distributions of module packages, you may want to
        do something like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  perl Build.PL --installdirs vendor
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  ./Build install --installdirs vendor
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you're installing an updated version of a module that was
        included with perl itself (i.e. a &quot;core module&quot;), then you may
        set <span class="Li">&quot;installdirs&quot;</span> to &quot;core&quot;
        to overwrite the module in its present location.</p>
    <p class="Pp">(Note that the 'script' line is different from
        <span class="Li">&quot;MakeMaker&quot;</span> - unfortunately there's no
        such thing as &quot;installsitescript&quot; or
        &quot;installvendorscript&quot; entry in
        <span class="Li">&quot;Config.pm&quot;</span>, so we use the
        &quot;installsitebin&quot; and &quot;installvendorbin&quot; entries to
        at least get the general location right. In the future, if
        <span class="Li">&quot;Config.pm&quot;</span> adds some more appropriate
        entries, we'll start using those.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>install_path</dt>
  <dd>Once the defaults have been set, you can override them.
    <p class="Pp">On the command line, that would look like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  perl Build.PL --install_path lib=/foo/lib --install_path arch=/foo/lib/arch
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  ./Build install --install_path lib=/foo/lib --install_path arch=/foo/lib/arch
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>install_base</dt>
  <dd>You can also set the whole bunch of installation paths by supplying the
      <span class="Li">&quot;install_base&quot;</span> parameter to point to a
      directory on your system. For instance, if you set
      <span class="Li">&quot;install_base&quot;</span> to &quot;/home/ken&quot;
      on a Linux system, you'll install as follows:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  lib     =&gt; /home/ken/lib/perl5
  arch    =&gt; /home/ken/lib/perl5/i386-linux
  script  =&gt; /home/ken/bin
  bin     =&gt; /home/ken/bin
  bindoc  =&gt; /home/ken/man/man1
  libdoc  =&gt; /home/ken/man/man3
  binhtml =&gt; /home/ken/html
  libhtml =&gt; /home/ken/html
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that this is <i>different</i> from how
        <span class="Li">&quot;MakeMaker&quot;</span>'s
        <span class="Li">&quot;PREFIX&quot;</span> parameter works.
        <span class="Li">&quot;install_base&quot;</span> just gives you a
        default layout under the directory you specify, which may have little to
        do with the <span class="Li">&quot;installdirs=site&quot;</span>
      layout.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The exact layout under the directory you specify may vary by
        system - we try to do the &quot;sensible&quot; thing on each
      platform.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>destdir</dt>
  <dd>If you want to install everything into a temporary directory first (for
      instance, if you want to create a directory tree that a package manager
      like <span class="Li">&quot;rpm&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;dpkg&quot;</span> could create a package from), you
      can use the <span class="Li">&quot;destdir&quot;</span> parameter:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  perl Build.PL --destdir /tmp/foo
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  ./Build install --destdir /tmp/foo
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This will effectively install to
        &quot;/tmp/foo/$sitelib&quot;, &quot;/tmp/foo/$sitearch&quot;, and the
        like, except that it will use
        <span class="Li">&quot;File::Spec&quot;</span> to make the pathnames
        work correctly on whatever platform you're installing on.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>prefix</dt>
  <dd>Provided for compatibility with
      <span class="Li">&quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot;</span>'s PREFIX argument.
      <span class="Li">&quot;prefix&quot;</span> should be used when you want
      Module::Build to install your modules, documentation, and scripts in the
      same place as <span class="Li">&quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot;</span>'s
      PREFIX mechanism.
    <p class="Pp">The following are equivalent.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    perl Build.PL --prefix /tmp/foo
    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/tmp/foo
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Because of the complex nature of the prefixification logic,
        the behavior of PREFIX in <span class="Li">&quot;MakeMaker&quot;</span>
        has changed subtly over time. Module::Build's --prefix logic is
        equivalent to the PREFIX logic found in
        <span class="Li">&quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot;</span> 6.30.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The maintainers of
        <span class="Li">&quot;MakeMaker&quot;</span> do understand the troubles
        with the PREFIX mechanism, and added INSTALL_BASE support in version
        6.31 of <span class="Li">&quot;MakeMaker&quot;</span>, which was
        released in 2006.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you don't need to retain compatibility with old versions
        (pre-6.31) of <span class="Li">&quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot;</span> or
        are starting a fresh Perl installation we recommend you use
        <span class="Li">&quot;install_base&quot;</span> instead (and
        <span class="Li">&quot;INSTALL_BASE&quot;</span> in
        <span class="Li">&quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot;</span>). See
        &quot;Installing in the same location as ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot; in
        Module::Build::Cookbook for further information.</p>

There are several reasons I wanted to start over, and not just fix what I didn't
  like about <span class="Li">&quot;MakeMaker&quot;</span>:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>I don't like the core idea of
      <span class="Li">&quot;MakeMaker&quot;</span>, namely that
      <span class="Li">&quot;make&quot;</span> should be involved in the build
      process. Here are my reasons:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>+</dt>
  <dd>When a person is installing a Perl module, what can you assume about their
      environment? Can you assume they have
      <span class="Li">&quot;make&quot;</span>? No, but you can assume they have
      some version of Perl.</dd>
  <dt>+</dt>
  <dd>When a person is writing a Perl module for intended distribution, can you
      assume that they know how to build a Makefile, so they can customize their
      build process? No, but you can assume they know Perl, and could customize
      that way.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">For years, these things have been a barrier to people getting the
    build/install process to do what they want.</p>
</div>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>There are several architectural decisions in
      <span class="Li">&quot;MakeMaker&quot;</span> that make it very difficult
      to customize its behavior. For instance, when using
      <span class="Li">&quot;MakeMaker&quot;</span> you do
      <span class="Li">&quot;use ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot;</span>, but the
      object created in <span class="Li">&quot;WriteMakefile()&quot;</span> is
      actually blessed into a package name that's created on the fly, so you
      can't simply subclass
      <span class="Li">&quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot;</span>. There is a
      workaround <span class="Li">&quot;MY&quot;</span> package that lets you
      override certain <span class="Li">&quot;MakeMaker&quot;</span> methods,
      but only certain explicitly preselected (by
      <span class="Li">&quot;MakeMaker&quot;</span>) methods can be overridden.
      Also, the method of customization is very crude: you have to modify a
      string containing the Makefile text for the particular target. Since these
      strings aren't documented, and <i>can't</i> be documented (they take on
      different values depending on the platform, version of perl, version of
      <span class="Li">&quot;MakeMaker&quot;</span>, etc.), you have no
      guarantee that your modifications will work on someone else's machine or
      after an upgrade of <span class="Li">&quot;MakeMaker&quot;</span> or
    perl.</li>
  <li>It is risky to make major changes to
      <span class="Li">&quot;MakeMaker&quot;</span>, since it does so many
      things, is so important, and generally works.
      <span class="Li">&quot;Module::Build&quot;</span> is an entirely separate
      package so that I can work on it all I want, without worrying about
      backward compatibility with
    <span class="Li">&quot;MakeMaker&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>Finally, Perl is said to be a language for system administration. Could it
      really be the case that Perl isn't up to the task of building and
      installing software? Even if that software is a bunch of
      <span class="Li">&quot;.pm&quot;</span> files that just need to be copied
      from one place to another? My sense was that we could design a system to
      accomplish this in a flexible, extensible, and friendly manner. Or die
      trying.</li>

The current method of relying on time stamps to determine whether a derived file
  is out of date isn't likely to scale well, since it requires tracing all
  dependencies backward, it runs into problems on NFS, and it's just generally
  flimsy. It would be better to use an MD5 signature or the like, if available.
  See <span class="Li">&quot;cons&quot;</span> for an example.
