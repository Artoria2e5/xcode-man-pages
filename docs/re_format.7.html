Regular expressions (&#x201C;REs&#x201D;), as defined in <span class="St">IEEE
  Std 1003.2 (&#x201C;POSIX.2&#x201D;)</span>, come in two forms: modern REs
  (roughly those of <a class="Xr">egrep(1)</a>; 1003.2 calls these
  &#x201C;extended&#x201D; REs) and obsolete REs (roughly those of
  <a class="Xr">ed(1)</a>; 1003.2 &#x201C;basic&#x201D; REs). Obsolete REs
  mostly exist for backward compatibility in some old programs; they will be
  discussed at the end. <span class="St">IEEE Std 1003.2
  (&#x201C;POSIX.2&#x201D;)</span> leaves some aspects of RE syntax and
  semantics open; `&#x2021;' marks decisions on these aspects that may not be
  fully portable to other <span class="St">IEEE Std 1003.2
  (&#x201C;POSIX.2&#x201D;)</span> implementations.
<p class="Pp">A (modern) RE is one&#x2021; or more non-empty&#x2021;
    <i class="Em">branches</i>, separated by
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">|</code>&#x2019;. It matches anything that matches
    one of the branches.</p>
<p class="Pp">A branch is one&#x2021; or more <i class="Em">pieces</i>,
    concatenated. It matches a match for the first, followed by a match for the
    second, etc.</p>
<p class="Pp">A piece is an <i class="Em">atom</i> possibly followed by a
    single&#x2021; &#x2018;<code class="Li">*</code>&#x2019;,
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">+</code>&#x2019;,
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">?</code>&#x2019;, or <i class="Em">bound</i>. An
    atom followed by &#x2018;<code class="Li">*</code>&#x2019; matches a
    sequence of 0 or more matches of the atom. An atom followed by
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">+</code>&#x2019; matches a sequence of 1 or more
    matches of the atom. An atom followed by
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">?</code>&#x2019; matches a sequence of 0 or 1
    matches of the atom.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <i class="Em">bound</i> is
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">{</code>&#x2019; followed by an unsigned decimal
    integer, possibly followed by &#x2018;<code class="Li">,</code>&#x2019;
    possibly followed by another unsigned decimal integer, always followed by
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">}</code>&#x2019;. The integers must lie between 0
    and <code class="Dv">RE_DUP_MAX</code> (255&#x2021;) inclusive, and if there
    are two of them, the first may not exceed the second. An atom followed by a
    bound containing one integer <i class="Em">i</i> and no comma matches a
    sequence of exactly <i class="Em">i</i> matches of the atom. An atom
    followed by a bound containing one integer <i class="Em">i</i> and a comma
    matches a sequence of <i class="Em">i</i> or more matches of the atom. An
    atom followed by a bound containing two integers <i class="Em">i</i> and
    <i class="Em">j</i> matches a sequence of <i class="Em">i</i> through
    <i class="Em">j</i> (inclusive) matches of the atom.</p>
<p class="Pp">An atom is a regular expression enclosed in
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">()</code>&#x2019; (matching a match for the regular
    expression), an empty set of &#x2018;<code class="Li">()</code>&#x2019;
    (matching the null string)&#x2021;, a <i class="Em">bracket expression</i>
    (see below), &#x2018;<code class="Li">.</code>&#x2019; (matching any single
    character), &#x2018;<code class="Li">^</code>&#x2019; (matching the null
    string at the beginning of a line),
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">$</code>&#x2019; (matching the null string at the
    end of a line), a &#x2018;<code class="Li">\</code>&#x2019; followed by one
    of the characters &#x2018;<code class="Li">^.[$()|*+?{\</code>&#x2019;
    (matching that character taken as an ordinary character), a
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">\</code>&#x2019; followed by any other
    character&#x2021; (matching that character taken as an ordinary character,
    as if the &#x2018;<code class="Li">\</code>&#x2019; had not been
    present&#x2021;), or a single character with no other significance (matching
    that character). A &#x2018;<code class="Li">{</code>&#x2019; followed by a
    character other than a digit is an ordinary character, not the beginning of
    a bound&#x2021;. It is illegal to end an RE with
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">\</code>&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <i class="Em">bracket expression</i> is a list of characters
    enclosed in &#x2018;<code class="Li">[]</code>&#x2019;. It normally matches
    any single character from the list (but see below). If the list begins with
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">^</code>&#x2019;, it matches any single character
    (but see below) <i class="Em">not</i> from the rest of the list. If two
    characters in the list are separated by
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">-</code>&#x2019;, this is shorthand for the full
    <i class="Em">range</i> of characters between those two (inclusive) in the
    collating sequence, <span class="No">e.g.</span>
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">[0-9]</code>&#x2019; in ASCII matches any decimal
    digit. It is illegal&#x2021; for two ranges to share an endpoint,
    <span class="No">e.g.</span> &#x2018;<code class="Li">a-c-e</code>&#x2019;.
    Ranges are very collating-sequence-dependent, and portable programs should
    avoid relying on them.</p>
<p class="Pp">To include a literal &#x2018;<code class="Li">]</code>&#x2019; in
    the list, make it the first character (following a possible
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">^</code>&#x2019;). To include a literal
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">-</code>&#x2019;, make it the first or last
    character, or the second endpoint of a range. To use a literal
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">-</code>&#x2019; as the first endpoint of a range,
    enclose it in &#x2018;<code class="Li">[.</code>&#x2019; and
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">.]</code>&#x2019; to make it a collating element
    (see below). With the exception of these and some combinations using
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">[</code>&#x2019; (see next paragraphs), all other
    special characters, including &#x2018;<code class="Li">\</code>&#x2019;,
    lose their special significance within a bracket expression.</p>
<p class="Pp">Within a bracket expression, a collating element (a character, a
    multi-character sequence that collates as if it were a single character, or
    a collating-sequence name for either) enclosed in
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">[.</code>&#x2019; and
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">.]</code>&#x2019; stands for the sequence of
    characters of that collating element. The sequence is a single element of
    the bracket expression's list. A bracket expression containing a
    multi-character collating element can thus match more than one character,
    e.g. if the collating sequence includes a
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">ch</code>&#x2019; collating element, then the RE
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">[[.ch.]]*c</code>&#x2019; matches the first five
    characters of &#x2018;<code class="Li">chchcc</code>&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Within a bracket expression, a collating element enclosed in
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">[=</code>&#x2019; and
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">=]</code>&#x2019; is an equivalence class, standing
    for the sequences of characters of all collating elements equivalent to that
    one, including itself. (If there are no other equivalent collating elements,
    the treatment is as if the enclosing delimiters were
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">[.</code>&#x2019; and
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">.]</code>&#x2019;.) For example, if
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">x</code>&#x2019; and
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">y</code>&#x2019; are the members of an equivalence
    class, then &#x2018;<code class="Li">[[=x=]]</code>&#x2019;,
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">[[=y=]]</code>&#x2019;, and
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">[xy]</code>&#x2019; are all synonymous. An
    equivalence class may not&#x2021; be an endpoint of a range.</p>
<p class="Pp">Within a bracket expression, the name of a <i class="Em">character
    class</i> enclosed in &#x2018;<code class="Li">[:</code>&#x2019; and
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">:]</code>&#x2019; stands for the list of all
    characters belonging to that class. Standard character class names are:</p>
<table class="Bl-column Bd-indent">
  <tr>
    <td><i class="Em">alnum</i></td>
    <td>digit</td>
    <td>punct</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i class="Em">alpha</i></td>
    <td>graph</td>
    <td>space</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i class="Em">blank</i></td>
    <td>lower</td>
    <td>upper</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i class="Em">cntrl</i></td>
    <td>print</td>
    <td>xdigit</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="Pp">These stand for the character classes defined in
    <a class="Xr">ctype(3)</a>. A locale may provide others. A character class
    may not be used as an endpoint of a range.</p>
<p class="Pp">A bracketed expression like
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">[[:class:]]</code>&#x2019; can be used to match a
    single character that belongs to a character class. The reverse, matching
    any character that does not belong to a specific class, the negation
    operator of bracket expressions may be used:
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">[^[:class:]]</code>&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are two special cases&#x2021; of bracket expressions: the
    bracket expressions &#x2018;<code class="Li">[[:&lt;:]]</code>&#x2019; and
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">[[:&gt;:]]</code>&#x2019; match the null string at
    the beginning and end of a word respectively. A word is defined as a
    sequence of word characters which is neither preceded nor followed by word
    characters. A word character is an <i class="Em">alnum</i> character (as
    defined by <a class="Xr">ctype(3)</a>) or an underscore. This is an
    extension, compatible with but not specified by <span class="St">IEEE Std
    1003.2 (&#x201C;POSIX.2&#x201D;)</span>, and should be used with caution in
    software intended to be portable to other systems.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the event that an RE could match more than one substring of a
    given string, the RE matches the one starting earliest in the string. If the
    RE could match more than one substring starting at that point, it matches
    the longest. Subexpressions also match the longest possible substrings,
    subject to the constraint that the whole match be as long as possible, with
    subexpressions starting earlier in the RE taking priority over ones starting
    later. Note that higher-level subexpressions thus take priority over their
    lower-level component subexpressions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Match lengths are measured in characters, not collating elements.
    A null string is considered longer than no match at all. For example,
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">bb*</code>&#x2019; matches the three middle
    characters of &#x2018;<code class="Li">abbbc</code>&#x2019;,
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">(wee|week)(knights|nights)</code>&#x2019; matches
    all ten characters of &#x2018;<code class="Li">weeknights</code>&#x2019;,
    when &#x2018;<code class="Li">(.*).*</code>&#x2019; is matched against
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">abc</code>&#x2019; the parenthesized subexpression
    matches all three characters, and when
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">(a*)*</code>&#x2019; is matched against
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">bc</code>&#x2019; both the whole RE and the
    parenthesized subexpression match the null string.</p>
<p class="Pp">If case-independent matching is specified, the effect is much as
    if all case distinctions had vanished from the alphabet. When an alphabetic
    that exists in multiple cases appears as an ordinary character outside a
    bracket expression, it is effectively transformed into a bracket expression
    containing both cases, <span class="No">e.g.</span>
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">x</code>&#x2019; becomes
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">[xX]</code>&#x2019;. When it appears inside a
    bracket expression, all case counterparts of it are added to the bracket
    expression, so that (e.g.) &#x2018;<code class="Li">[x]</code>&#x2019;
    becomes &#x2018;<code class="Li">[xX]</code>&#x2019; and
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">[^x]</code>&#x2019; becomes
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">[^xX]</code>&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="Pp">No particular limit is imposed on the length of REs&#x2021;.
    Programs intended to be portable should not employ REs longer than 256
    bytes, as an implementation can refuse to accept such REs and remain
    POSIX-compliant.</p>
<p class="Pp">Obsolete (&#x201C;basic&#x201D;) regular expressions differ in
    several respects. &#x2018;<code class="Li">|</code>&#x2019; is an ordinary
    character and there is no equivalent for its functionality.
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">+</code>&#x2019; and
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">?</code>&#x2019; are ordinary characters, and their
    functionality can be expressed using bounds
    (&#x2018;<code class="Li">{1,}</code>&#x2019; or
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">{0,1}</code>&#x2019; respectively). Also note that
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">x+</code>&#x2019; in modern REs is equivalent to
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">xx*</code>&#x2019;. The delimiters for bounds are
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">\{</code>&#x2019; and
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">\}</code>&#x2019;, with
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">{</code>&#x2019; and
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">}</code>&#x2019; by themselves ordinary characters.
    The parentheses for nested subexpressions are
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">\(</code>&#x2019; and
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">\)</code>&#x2019;, with
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">(</code>&#x2019; and
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">)</code>&#x2019; by themselves ordinary characters.
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">^</code>&#x2019; is an ordinary character except at
    the beginning of the RE or&#x2021; the beginning of a parenthesized
    subexpression, &#x2018;<code class="Li">$</code>&#x2019; is an ordinary
    character except at the end of the RE or&#x2021; the end of a parenthesized
    subexpression, and &#x2018;<code class="Li">*</code>&#x2019; is an ordinary
    character if it appears at the beginning of the RE or the beginning of a
    parenthesized subexpression (after a possible leading
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">^</code>&#x2019;). Finally, there is one new type
    of atom, a <i class="Em">back reference</i>:
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">\</code>&#x2019; followed by a non-zero decimal
    digit <i class="Em">d</i> matches the same sequence of characters matched by
    the <i class="Em">d</i>th parenthesized subexpression (numbering
    subexpressions by the positions of their opening parentheses, left to
    right), so that (e.g.) &#x2018;<code class="Li">\([bc]\)\1</code>&#x2019;
    matches &#x2018;<code class="Li">bb</code>&#x2019; or
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">cc</code>&#x2019; but not
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">bc</code>&#x2019;.</p>

  FEATURES</a></h1>
When the <code class="Dv">REG_ENHANCED</code> flag is passed to one of the
  <code class="Fn">regcomp</code>() variants, additional features are activated.
  Like the enhanced <code class="Nm">regex</code> implementations in scripting
  languages such as <a class="Xr">perl(1)</a> and <a class="Xr">python(1)</a>,
  these additional features may conflict with the <span class="St">IEEE Std
  1003.2 (&#x201C;POSIX.2&#x201D;)</span> standards in some ways. Use this with
  care in situations which require portability (including to past versions of
  the Mac OS X using the previous <code class="Nm">regex</code> implementation).
<p class="Pp">For enhanced basic REs, &#x2018;<code class="Li">+</code>&#x2019;,
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">?</code>&#x2019; and
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">|</code>&#x2019; remain regular characters, but
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">\+</code>&#x2019;,
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">\?</code>&#x2019; and
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">\|</code>&#x2019; have the same special meaning as
    the unescaped characters do for extended REs, i.e., one or more matches,
    zero or one matches and alteration, respectively. For enhanced extended REs,
    back references are available. Additional enhanced features are listed
    below.</p>
<p class="Pp">Within a bracket expression, most characters lose their magic.
    This also applies to the additional enhanced features, which don't operate
    inside a bracket expression.</p>

  Sequences (available for both enhanced basic and enhanced extended

Literals are normally just ordinary characters that are matched directly. Under
  enhanced mode, certain character sequences are converted to specific literals.
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b class="Sy">\a</b></dt>
  <dd>The &#x201C;bell&#x201D; character (ASCII code 7).</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">\e</b></dt>
  <dd>The &#x201C;escape&#x201D; character (ASCII code 27).</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">\f</b></dt>
  <dd>The &#x201C;form-feed&#x201D; character (ASCII code 12).</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">\n</b></dt>
  <dd>The &#x201C;new-line/line-feed&#x201D; character (ASCII code 10).</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">\r</b></dt>
  <dd>The &#x201C;carriage-return&#x201D; character (ASCII code 13).</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">\t</b></dt>
  <dd>The &#x201C;horizontal-tab&#x201D; character (ASCII code 9).</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Literals can also be specified directly, using their wide
    character values. Note that when matching a multibyte character string, the
    string's bytes are converted to wide character before comparing. This means
    that a single literal wide character value may match more than one string
    byte, depending on the locale's wide character encoding.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b class="Sy">\x</b><i class="Em">x..</i></dt>
  <dd>An arbitray eight-bit value. The <i class="Em">x..</i> sequence represents
      zero, one or two hexadecimal digits. (Note: if <i class="Em">x..</i> is
      less than two hexadecimal digits, and the character following this
      sequence happens to be a hexadecimal digit, use the (following) brace form
      to avoid confusion.)</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">\x{</b><i class="Em">x..</i><b class="Sy">}</b></dt>
  <dd>An arbitrary, up to 32-bit value. The <i class="Em">x..</i> sequence is an
      arbitrary sequence of hexadecimal digits that is long enough to represent
      the necessary value.</dd>

A &#x2018;<code class="Li">\Q</code>&#x2019; sequence causes literal
  (&#x201C;quote&#x201D;) mode to be entered, while
  &#x2018;<code class="Li">\E</code>&#x2019; ends literal mode, and returns to
  normal regular expression processing. This is similar to specifying the
  <code class="Dv">REG_NOSPEC</code> (or <code class="Dv">REG_LITERAL</code>)
  option to <code class="Fn">regcomp</code>(), except that rather than applying
  to the whole RE string, it only applies to the part between the
  &#x2018;<code class="Li">\Q</code>&#x2019; and
  &#x2018;<code class="Li">\E</code>&#x2019;. Note that it is not possible to
  have a &#x2018;<code class="Li">\E</code>&#x2019; in the middle of an inline
  literal range, as that would terminate literal mode prematurely.

<h2 class="Ss" id="Minimal_Repetitions_(available_for_enhanced_extended_REs_only)"><a class="permalink" href="#Minimal_Repetitions_(available_for_enhanced_extended_REs_only)">Minimal
  Repetitions (available for enhanced extended REs only)</a></h2>
By default, the repetition operators, &#x2018;<code class="Li">*</code>&#x2019;,
  <i class="Em">bound</i>, &#x2018;<code class="Li">?</code>&#x2019; and
  &#x2018;<code class="Li">+</code>&#x2019; are <i class="Em">greedy</i>; they
  try to match as many times as possible. In enhanced mode, appending a
  &#x2018;<code class="Li">?</code>&#x2019; to a repetition operator makes it
  minimal (or <i class="Em">ungreedy</i>); it tries to match the fewest number
  of times (including zero times, as appropriate).
<p class="Pp">For example, against the string
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">aaa</code>&#x2019;, the RE
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">a*</code>&#x2019; would match the entire string,
    while &#x2018;<code class="Li">a*?</code>&#x2019; would match the null
    string at the beginning of the line (matches zero times). Likewise, against
    the string &#x2018;<code class="Li">ababab</code>&#x2019;, the RE
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">.*b</code>&#x2019;, would also match the entire
    string, while &#x2018;<code class="Li">.*?b</code>&#x2019; would only match
    the first two characters.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Fn">regcomp</code>() flag
    <code class="Dv">REG_UNGREEDY</code> will make the regular (greedy)
    repetition operators ungreedy by default. Appending
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">?</code>&#x2019; makes them greedy again.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that minimal repetitions are not specified by an official
    standard, so there may be differences between different implementations. In
    the current implementation, minimal repetitions have a high precedence, and
    can cause other standards requirements to be violated. For instance, on the
    string &#x2018;<code class="Li">aaaaa</code>&#x2019;, the RE
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">(aaa??)*</code>&#x2019; will only match the first
    four characters, violating the rules that the longest possible match is made
    and the longest subexpressions are matched. Using
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">(aaa??)*$</code>&#x2019; forces the entire string
    to be matched.</p>

  Parenthesized Subexpressions (available for enhanced extended REs
  only)</a></h2>
Normally, the match offsets to parenthesized subexpressions are recorded in the
  <var class="Fa">pmatch</var> array (that is, when
  <code class="Dv">REG_NOSUB</code> is not specified, and
  <var class="Fa">nmatch</var> is large enough to encompass the parenthesized
  subexpression in question). In enhanced mode, if the first two characters
  following the left parenthesis are &#x2018;<code class="Li">?:</code>&#x2019;,
  grouping of the remaining contents is done, but the corresponding offsets are
  not recorded in the <var class="Fa">pmatch</var> array. For example, against
  the string &#x2018;<code class="Li">fubar</code>&#x2019;, the RE
  &#x2018;<code class="Li">(fu)(bar)</code>&#x2019; would have two subexpression
  matches in <var class="Fa">pmatch</var>; the first for
  &#x2018;<code class="Li">fu</code>&#x2019; and the second for
  &#x2018;<code class="Li">bar</code>&#x2019;. But with the RE
  &#x2018;<code class="Li">(?:fu)(bar)</code>&#x2019;, there would only be one
  subexpression match, that of &#x2018;<code class="Li">bar</code>&#x2019;.
  Furthermore, against the string
  &#x2018;<code class="Li">fufubar</code>&#x2019;, the RE
  &#x2018;<code class="Li">(?fu)*(bar)</code>&#x2019; would again match the
  entire string, but only &#x2018;<code class="Li">bar</code>&#x2019; would be
  recorded in <var class="Fa">pmatch</var>.

  Options (available for enhanced extended REs only)</a></h2>
Like the inline literal mode mentioned above, other options can be switched on
  and off for part of a RE.
  &#x2018;<code class="Li">(?<i class="Em">o..</i>)</code>&#x2019; will turn on
  the options specified in <i class="Em">o..</i> (one or more options
  characters; see below), while
  &#x2018;<code class="Li">(?-<i class="Em">o..</i>)</code>&#x2019; will turn
  off the specified options, and
  &#x2018;<code class="Li">(?<i class="Em">o1..</i>-<i class="Em">o2..</i>)</code>&#x2019;
  will turn on the first set of options, and turn off the second set.
<p class="Pp">The available options are:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b class="Sy">i</b></dt>
  <dd>Turning on this option will ignore case during matching, while turning off
      will restore case-sensitive matching. If <code class="Dv">REG_ICASE</code>
      was specified to <code class="Fn">regcomp</code>(), this option can be use
      to turn that off.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">n</b></dt>
  <dd>Turn on or off special handling of the newline character. If
      <code class="Dv">REG_NEWLINE</code> was specified to
      <code class="Fn">regcomp</code>(), this option can be use to turn that
      off.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">U</b></dt>
  <dd>Turning on this option will make ungreedy repetitions the default, while
      turning off will make greedy repetitions the default. If
      <code class="Dv">REG_UNGREEDY</code> was specified to
      <code class="Fn">regcomp</code>(), this option can be use to turn that
      off.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The scope of the option change begins immediately following the
    right parenthesis, but up to the end of the enclosing subexpression (if
    any). Thus, for example, given the RE
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">(fu(?i)bar)baz</code>&#x2019;, the
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">fu</code>&#x2019; portion matches case sensitively,
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">bar</code>&#x2019; matches case insensitively, and
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">baz</code>&#x2019; matches case sensitively again
    (since is it outside the scope of the subexpression in which the inline
    option was specified).</p>
<p class="Pp">The inline options syntax can be combined with the non-capturing
    parenthesized subexpression to limit the option scope to just that of the
    subexpression. Then, for example,
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">fu(?i:bar)baz</code>&#x2019; is similar to the
    previous example, except for the parenthesize subexpression around
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">fu(?i)bar</code>&#x2019; in the previous
  example.</p>

The syntax &#x2018;<code class="Li">(?#<i class="Em">comment</i>)</code>&#x2019;
  can be used to embed comments within a RE. Note that <i class="Em">comment</i>
  can not contain a right parenthesis. Also note that while syntactically,
  option characters can be added before the
  &#x2018;<code class="Li">#</code>&#x2019; character, they will be ignored.

Having two kinds of REs is a botch.
<p class="Pp">The current <span class="St">IEEE Std 1003.2

    an unintentional result of a wording error, and change is likely. Avoid
    relying on it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Back references are a dreadful botch, posing major problems for
    efficient implementations. They are also somewhat vaguely defined (does
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">a\(\(b\)*\2\)*d</code>&#x2019; match
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">abbbd</code>&#x2019;?). Avoid using them.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="St">IEEE Std 1003.2 (&#x201C;POSIX.2&#x201D;)</span>
    specification of case-independent matching is vague. The &#x201C;one case
