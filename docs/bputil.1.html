This utility is not meant for normal users or even sysadmins. It provides
  unabstracted access to capabilities which are normally handled for the user
  automatically when changing the security policy through GUIs such as the
  Startup Security Utility in macOS Recovery. It is possible to make your system
  security much weaker and therefore easier to compromise using this tool. This
  tool is not to be used in production environments. It is possible to render
  your system unbootable with this tool. It should only be used to understand
  how the security of Apple Silicon Macs works. Use at your own risk!
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">bputil</code> performs actions by calling the
    BootPolicy library. This modifies the security configuration of the system,
    which is stored in a file called the LocalPolicy. This file is digitally
    signed by the Secure Enclave Processor (SEP). The private key which is used
    to sign the LocalPolicy is protected by a separate key which is only
    accessible when a user has put in their password as part of a successful
    authentication. This is why this tool must either have a username and
    password specified on the command line, or via the interactive prompt.</p>
<p class="Pp">By design, the SEP application which is responsible for making
    changes to the LocalPolicy will inspect the boot state of the main
    Application Processor (AP). It will only allow the below
    security-downgrading operations if it detects that the AP is in the intended
    boot state. When System Integrity Protection (SIP) was first introduced to
    Macs, it was decided that requiring a reboot to macOS Recovery would provide
    intentional friction which would make it harder for malicious software to
    downgrade the system. That precedent is extended here to detect the special
    boot to macOS Recovery via holding the power key at boot time. We refer to
    this as One True Recovery (1TR), and most of the below downgrade options
    will only work when booted into 1TR, not when called from normal macOS. This
    helps ensure that only a physically-present user, not malicious software
    running in macOS, can permanently downgrade the security settings. The below
    CLI options specify what boot environments a downgrade can be performed
    from.</p>
<p class="Pp">The SEP-signed LocalPolicy is evaluated at boot time by iBoot.
    Configurations within the LocalPolicy change iBoot's behavior, such as
    whether it will require that all boot objects must be signed with metadata
    specific to the particular machine (a &quot;personalized&quot; signature,
    which is the default, and the always-required policy on iOS), or whether it
    will accept &quot;global&quot; signatures which are valid for all units of a
    specific hardware model. The LocalPolicy can also influence other boot or OS
    security behavior as described in the below options.</p>

    <p class="Pp">Changes security mode to Full Security. This option is
        mutually exclusive with all options below which cause security
        downgrades. Full Security is effectively a LocalPolicy which is in its
        default state, lacking all available security downgrades. Full Security
        also performs an online check at software install and upgrade time to
        ensure that only the latest version of software can be installed. This
        prevents accidentally installing old software which has known
        vulnerabilities in it. If the security is downgraded away from Full
        Security, and then re-upgraded to Full Security, the online check will
        be performed, and if the software is no longer the latest available, it
        will not be possible to set it to Full Security again. Because online
        checks are only performed at software installation, upgrade, and Full
        Security policy setting time, it is possible for an OS to report that it
        is Full Security despite not being the latest software version. Full
        Security only indicates the state as of the latest install or
      upgrade.</p>

    <p class="Pp">Selecting this option will make your system easier to

    <p class="Pp">This changes the security mode to Reduced Security. Reduced
        Security will use the &quot;global&quot; digital signature for macOS, in
        order to allow running software which is not the latest version. Thus
        anything other than the latest software therefore may have security
        vulnerabilities. At a high level, Reduced Security does not necessarily
        require the latest software, but it does still require all software be
        digitally signed by Apple or 3rd party software developers. Passing this
        option will explicitly recreate the LocalPolicy from scratch, (i.e. it
        does not preserve any existing security policy options) and only the
        options specified via this tool will exist in the output local
      policy.</p>

    <p class="Pp">This changes the security mode to Permissive Security.
        Permissive Security uses the same &quot;global&quot; digital signature
        for macOS as the above Reduced Security option, in order to allow
        running software which is not the latest version. Thus anything other
        than the latest software therefore may have security vulnerabilities. At
        a high level, Permissive Security allows configuration options to be set
        to not require all software to be digitally signed. This can allow users
        who are not part of the Apple Developer program to still be able to
        introduce their own software into their system. Additionally, especially
        dangerous security downgrades may be restricted to Permissive Security,
        and only available via CLI tools for power users rather than GUIs.
        Passing this option will explicitly recreate the LocalPolicy from
        scratch, (i.e. it does not preserve any existing security policy

        Region&quot; (CTRR) hardware register. Introducing 3rd party kernel
        extensions can introduce architectural or implementation flaws into the
        kernel, which can lead to system compromise. In order to achieve
        iOS-like security properties, 3rd party kexts must be denied by default,
        and only loadable if the customer consciously opts in to lowering their
        security from 1TR.</p>

    <p class="Pp">This disables the enforcement of the &quot;Configurable Text
        Read-only Region&quot; (CTRR) hardware register that marks kernel memory
        as non-writable. This is sometimes required for performing actions such
        as using dynamic DTrace code hooks to profile kernel behavior or perform
        3rd party kernel extension debugging. However, the lack of CTRR
        enforcement makes it much easier for an attacker to modify the kernel
        with exploits.</p>

    <p class="Pp">The macOS kernel accepts a variety of configuration options
        via an nvram variable named &quot;boot-args&quot;. However, some of
        these options direct the kernel to reduce some security enforcement. In
        order to achieve iOS-like security properties, this security-downgrading
        behavior needs to be denied by default, and only available if the
        customer consciously opts in to lowering their security from 1TR.</p>

    <p class="Pp">The Signed System Volume is a mechanism to digitally sign and
        verify all data from the System volume (where the primary macOS software
        is stored). The result is that malware cannot directly manipulate
        executables there in order to achieve persistent execution, or
        manipulate the data stored there in order to try to exploit programs.
        This option disables Signed System Volume integrity enforcement, to
        allow customers to modify the System volume. SSV cannot be disabled
        while FileVault is enabled. Customer modifications to the System volume
        are not expected to persist across software updates.</p>
