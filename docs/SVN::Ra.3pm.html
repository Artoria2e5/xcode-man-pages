SVN::Ra wraps the object-oriented
  <span class="Li">&quot;svn_ra_plugin_t&quot;</span> functions, providing
  access to a Subversion repository though a URL, using whichever repository
  access module is appropriate.

The constructor creates an RA object and calls
  <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> for it. Its parameters are either a
  hash of options or a single value containing the URL of the repository. Valid
  options are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>url</dt>
  <dd>The URL of the repository.</dd>
  <dt>auth</dt>
  <dd>An <span class="Li">&quot;auth_baton&quot;</span> could be given to the
      SVN::RA object. Defaults to an
      <span class="Li">&quot;auth_provider&quot;</span> with a
      <span class="Li">&quot;username_provider&quot;</span>. See SVN::Client for
      how to create <span class="Li">&quot;auth_baton&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>pool</dt>
  <dd>The pool for the RA session to use. Member functions will also be called
      with this pool. Defaults to a newly created root pool.</dd>
  <dt>config</dt>
  <dd>The config hash that could be obtained by calling
      <span class="Li">&quot;SVN::Core::config_get_config(undef)&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>callback</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;ra_callback&quot;</span> namespace to use.
      Defaults to SVN::Ra::Callbacks.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The following examples will both do the same thing, with all the
    optional arguments taking their defaults:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

Please consult the svn_ra.h section in the Subversion API. Member functions of
  <span class="Li">&quot;svn_ra_plugin_t&quot;</span> can be called as methods
  of SVN::Ra objects, with the <span class="Li">&quot;session_baton&quot;</span>
  and <span class="Li">&quot;pool&quot;</span> arguments omitted.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>$ra-&gt;change_rev_prop($revnum, $name, $value)</dt>
  <dd>Sets the revision (unversioned) property <span class="Li">$name</span> to
      <span class="Li">$value</span> on revision
      <span class="Li">$revnum</span>, or removes the property if

      available.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>$ra-&gt;check_path($path, $revnum)</dt>
  <dd>Kind of node at <span class="Li">$path</span> in revision
      <span class="Li">$revnum</span>. A number which matches one of these
      constants: <span class="Li">$SVN::Node::none</span>,

  <dd></dd>
  <dt>$ra-&gt;do_diff2($revision, $target, $recurse, $ignore_ancestry,
    $text_deltas, $versus_url, $editor)</dt>
  <dd>Both of these return a SVN::Ra::Reporter with which you can describe a
      working copy. It will then call methods on <span class="Li">$editor</span>
      to indicates the differences between the repository and the working copy.
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;do_diff2&quot;</span> method was
        added in Subversion&#x00A0;1.4. It adds the
        <span class="Li">$text_deltas</span> option, which if false disables the
        generation of text deltas on the editor. With
        <span class="Li">&quot;do_diff&quot;</span> text deltas are always
        generated.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    my $reporter = $ra-&gt;do_diff(1, '', 1, 0, $repos_url,

    $reporter-&gt;finish_report;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>$ra-&gt;do_status($target, $revision, $recurse, $editor)</dt>
  <dd>Returns a SVN::Ra::Reporter to which you can describe the status of a
      working copy. It will then call methods on <span class="Li">$editor</span>
      to describe the current status of the working copy compared to the
      repository.</dd>
  <dt>$ra-&gt;do_switch($revnum, $target, $recurse, $repos_url, $editor)</dt>
  <dd>Returns a SVN::Ra::Reporter with which you can describe a working copy. It
      will then call methods on <span class="Li">$editor</span> to indicate how
      to adjust the working copy to switch it to revision
      <span class="Li">$revnum</span> of
    <span class="Li">$repos_url</span>.</dd>
  <dt>$ra-&gt;do_update($revision_to_update_to, $target, $recurse, $editor)</dt>
  <dd>Returns a SVN::Ra::Reporter object. Call methods on the reporter to
      describe the current state of your working copy (or whatever you're
      updating). After calling the reporter's
      <span class="Li">&quot;finish_report()&quot;</span> method, Subversion
      will generate calls to your <span class="Li">$editor</span> to describe
      the differences between what you already have and the state of the
      repository in <span class="Li">$revision_to_update_to</span>.
    <p class="Pp">To update to the latest revision, pass
        <span class="Li">$SVN::Core::INVALID_REVNUM</span> for the first
        argument.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$target</span> should be the path to the part
        of the repository you are interested in. You won't be given information
        about changes outside this path. If you want everything, pass an empty
        string.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">$recurse</span> is true and the target is
        a directory, update recursively; otherwise, update just the target and
        its immediate entries, but not its child directories (if any).</p>
    <p class="Pp">All paths are relative to the URL used to open
        <span class="Li">$ra</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The caller may not perform any RA operations using
        <span class="Li">$ra</span> before finishing the report, and may not
        perform any RA operations using <span class="Li">$ra</span> from within
        the editing operations of <span class="Li">$editor</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This example shows the simplest update, where the client tells
        the reporter that it has nothing to start with:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    my $reporter = $ra-&gt;do_update($revnum, '', 1, MyEditor-&gt;new);
    $reporter-&gt;set_path('', 0, 1, undef);
    $reporter-&gt;finish_report;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>$ra-&gt;get_commit_editor($logmsg, $callback, $callback_baton,
    $lock_tokens, $keep_locks)</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>$ra-&gt;get_commit_editor2($logmsg, $callback, $callback_baton,
    $lock_tokens, $keep_locks)</dt>
  <dd>Return an opaque editor object for committing a new revision to the
      repository. The return values should be passed to the SVN::Delta::Editor
      constructor to create an editor object you can actually use. For example:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    my $editor = SVN::Delta::Editor-&gt;new(
        $ra-&gt;get_commit_editor(
            &quot;I'm going to commit some changes from within my Perl code.&quot;,
            \&amp;commit_callback, undef, {}, 0));
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Now that you've got your editor you can call methods on it to
        describe changes in the tree you want to make, such as adding
        directories, changing file contents, etc. See SVN::Delta for
        documentation of the editor interface.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">$callback</span> function will be called
        during your call to the
        <span class="Li">&quot;$ed-&gt;close_edit()&quot;</span> method, after
        the commit has succeeded. It will not be called if there were no changes
        to commit. If you don't need it, pass undef instead of a code ref.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;get_commit_editor2&quot;</span> is
        identical to <span class="Li">&quot;get_commit_editor&quot;</span>
        except for the information passed to the callback function. The new
        version, added in Subversion&#x00A0;1.4, will pass the callback a single
        value (TODO: I can' test this, but it's probably an object or hash ref)
        which contains all the information. It also includes the error message
        from the post-commit hook script, which is not available with
        <span class="Li">&quot;get_commit_editor&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The callback for the original version will be passed three
        arguments:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Number of the new revision.</li>
  <li>Date and time that the revision was committed, which will be exactly the
      same value as its <span class="Li">&quot;svn:date&quot;</span> revision
      property. It will be in this format:
      <span class="Li">&quot;2006-04-05T12:17:48.180320Z&quot;</span></li>
  <li>The name of the author who committed the revision, which will be the same
      as the <span class="Li">&quot;svn:author&quot;</span> revision
    property.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The undef in the argument list in the example above is the baton
    which is meant to be passed to the commit callback, but it isn't. This isn't
    a problem since you can supply a closure as the callback so that it can get
    to whatever variables you need.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">$logmsg</span> value should be a string which
    will be stored in the <span class="Li">&quot;svn:log&quot;</span> revision
    property. If undef is passed instead then the new revision won't have a
    <span class="Li">&quot;svn:log&quot;</span> property.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$lock_tokens</span> should be a reference to a
    hash mapping the paths to lock tokens to use for them. I seems that with
    Subversion&#x00A0;1.2 this is required, so if you aren't using any locks
    simply pass <span class="Li">&quot;{}&quot;</span>. In
    Subversion&#x00A0;1.3.1 though it seems to be necessary to <i>not</i> pass
    this argument at all.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">$keep_locks</span> is true then locks on the
    files committed won't be released by the commit.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;get_commit_editor()&quot;</span> method
    itself returns a list of two items, the first of which (a
    <span class="Li">&quot;_p_svn_delta_editor_t&quot;</span> object) is the
    actual editor. The second is the editor baton. Neither is of any use without
    wrapping the pair of them in a SVN::Delta::Editor.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>$ra-&gt;get_dated_revision($time)</dt>

  <dd>Fetch the directory entries and properties of the directory at
      <span class="Li">$path</span> in revision <span class="Li">$revnum</span>
    <p class="Pp">A list of three values are returned. The first is a reference
        to a hash of directory entries. The keys are the names of all the files
        and directories in <span class="Li">$path</span> (not full paths, just
        the filenames). The values are _p_svn_dirent_t objects, with all their
        fields filled in. The third parameter to
        <span class="Li">&quot;get_dir2&quot;</span> allows you to select
        particular fields. TODO: I don't think the constants you'd use to
        construct the <span class="Li">$dirent_fields</span> value are provided
        in the Perl API.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The second value is a number, which is only valid if

        <span class="Li">$SVN::Core::INVALID_REVNUM</span>. If that is the case
        then the latest revision will be fetched, and the revision number (the
        HEAD revision) will be returned as the second value. Otherwise the
        revision number returned will be completely arbitrary.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The third value returned will be a reference to a hash of all
        properties on the directory. This means <i>all</i> properties: not just
        ones controlled by the user and stored in the repository fs, but
        non-tweakable ones generated by the SCM system itself (e.g. 'wcprops',

  <span class="Li">&quot;do_update&quot;</span> all return a SVN::Ra::Reporter

  information should be provided through a tree delta editor.
<p class="Pp">Objects of this class are actually simple wrappers around

  <dd>Describe a working copy <span class="Li">$path</span> as being at a

    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">$start_empty</span> is true and

        paths. <span class="Li">$path</span> is relative to the URL specified in
        <span class="Li">&quot;SVN::Ra-&gt;open()&quot;</span> or

      the report driver) isn't a reflection of <span class="Li">$path</span> in
      the repository (relative to the URL specified when opening the RA layer),
      but is instead a reflection of a different repository
      <span class="Li">$url</span> at <span class="Li">$revision</span>.
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">$start_empty</span> is true and
        <span class="Li">$path</span> is a directory, the implementor should
