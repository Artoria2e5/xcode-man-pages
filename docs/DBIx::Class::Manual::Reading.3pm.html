   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

DBIx::Class::Manual::Reading - How to read and write DBIx::Class POD.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This doc should help users to understand how the examples and documentation
  found in the DBIx::Class distribution can be interpreted.
<p class="Pp">Writers of DBIx::Class POD should also check here to make sure
    their additions are consistent with the rest of the documentation.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="METHODS"><a class="permalink" href="#METHODS">METHODS</a></h1>
Methods should be documented in the files which also contain the code for the
  method, or that file should be hidden from PAUSE completely, in which case the
  methods are documented in the file which loads it. Methods may also be
  documented and referred to in files representing the major objects or
  components on which they can be called.
<p class="Pp">For example, DBIx::Class::Relationship documents the methods
    actually coded in the helper relationship classes like
    DBIx::Class::Relationship::BelongsTo. The BelongsTo file itself is hidden
    from PAUSE as it has no documentation. The accessors created by
    relationships should be mentioned in DBIx::Class::Row, the major object that
    they will be called on.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Method_documentation"><a class="permalink" href="#Method_documentation">Method
  documentation</a></h2>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Each method starts with a &quot;head2&quot; statement of its name.
    <p class="Pp">Just the plain method name, not an example of how to call it,
        or a link. This is to ensure easy linking to method documentation from
        other POD.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The header is followed by a two-item list. This contains a description of
      the arguments the method is expected to take, and an indication of what
      the method returns.
    <p class="Pp">The first item provides a list of all possible values for the
        arguments of the method in order, separated by <span class="Li">&quot;,
        &quot;</span>, preceded by the text &quot;Arguments: &quot;</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example (for the belongs_to relationship):</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  =item Arguments: $accessor_name, $related_class, $fk_column|\%cond|\@cond?, \%attr?
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The following possible argument sigils can be shown:</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><span class="Li">$var</span> - A scalar (string or numeric) variable.</li>
  <li>\%var - A variable containing reference to a hash.</li>
  <li>\@var - A variable containing a reference to an array.</li>
  <li>\$var - A variable containing a reference to a scalar variable.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">%var</span> - A hashref variable (list of key/value
      pairs) - rarely used in DBIx::Class.
    <p class="Pp">Reading an argument as a hash variable will consume all
        subsequent method arguments, use with caution.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">@var</span> - An array variable (list of values).
    <p class="Pp">Reading an argument as a array variable will consume all
        subsequent method arguments, use with caution.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">$obj</span> - Reference to the source class or object
      definition
    <p class="Pp">All arguments and return values should provide a link to the
        object's class documentation or definition, even if it's the same class
        as the current documentation. For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  ## Correct, if stated within DBIx::Class::ResultSet
  L&lt;$resultset|/new&gt;

  ## Correct, if stated outside DBIx::Class::ResultSet
  L&lt;$resultset|DBIx::Class::ResultSet&gt;
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>? - Optional, should be placed after the argument type and name.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
  ## Correct
  \%myhashref|\@myarrayref?

  ## Wrong
  \%myhashref?|\@myarrayref
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Applies to the entire argument.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Optional arguments can be left out of method calls, unless the
        caller needs to pass in any of the following arguments. In which case
        the caller should pass <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> in
        place of the missing argument.</p>
  </li>
  <li>| - Alternate argument content types.
    <p class="Pp">At least one of these must be supplied unless the argument is
        also marked optional.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The second item starts with the text &quot;Return Value:&quot;.
    The remainder of the line is either the text &quot;not defined&quot; or a
    variable with a descriptive name.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  ## Good examples
  =item Return Value: not defined
  =item Return Value: L&lt;$schema|DBIx::Class::Schema&gt;
  =item Return Value: $classname

  ## Bad examples
  =item Return Value: The names
</pre>
<p class="Pp">&quot;not defined&quot; means the method does not deliberately
    return a value, and the caller should not use or rely on anything it does
    return. (Perl functions always return something, usually the result of the
    last code statement, if there is no explicit return statement.) This is
    different than specifying &quot;undef&quot;, which means that it explicitly
    returns undef, though usually this is used an alternate return (like
    <span class="Li">&quot;$obj | undef&quot;</span>).</p>
</div>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The argument/return list is followed by a single paragraph describing what
      the method does.</li>
  <li>The description paragraph is followed by another list. Each item in the
      list explains one of the possible argument/type combinations.
    <p class="Pp">This list may be omitted if the author feels that the variable
        names are self-explanatory enough to not require it. Use best
      judgement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The argument/return list is followed by some examples of how to use the
      method, using its various types of arguments.
    <p class="Pp">The examples can also include ways to use the results if
        applicable. For instance, if the documentation is for a relationship
        type, the examples can include how to call the resulting relation
        accessor, how to use the relation name in a search and so on.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If some of the examples assume default values, these should be
        shown with and without the actual arguments, with hints about the
        equivalent calls.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The example should be followed by one or more paragraphs
        explaining what it does.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Examples and explaining paragraphs can be repeated as
        necessary.</p>
