pcap-linktype - link-layer header types supported by libpcap

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
For a live capture or ``savefile'', libpcap supplies, as the return value of the
  <b>pcap_datalink</b>(3PCAP) routine, a value that indicates the type of
  link-layer header at the beginning of the packets it provides. This is not
  necessarily the type of link-layer header that the packets being captured have
  on the network from which they're being captured; for example, packets from an
  IEEE 802.11 network might be provided by libpcap with Ethernet headers that
  the network adapter or the network adapter driver generates from the 802.11
  headers. The names for those values begin with <b>DLT_</b>, so they are
  sometimes called &quot;DLT_ values&quot;.
<p class="Pp">The values stored in the link-layer header type field in the
    savefile header are, in most but not all cases, the same as the values
    returned by <b>pcap_datalink()</b>. The names for those values begin with
    <b>LINKTYPE_</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The link-layer header types supported by libpcap are described at
    https://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html.</p>
