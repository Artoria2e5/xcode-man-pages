<code class="Nm">synthetic.conf</code> describes virtual symbolic links and
  empty directories to be created at the root mount point. Because the root
  mount point is read-only as of macOS 10.15, physical files may not be created
  at this location. All writeable paths must reside on the data volume, which is
  mounted at <i class="Em">/System/Volumes/Data</i>.
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">synthetic.conf</code> provides a mechanism for
    some limited, user-controlled file-creation at <i class="Em">/</i>. The
    synthetic entities described in this file are synthesized by the kernel
    during early system boot. They are not physically present on the disk, but
    when the system is booted, they behave as if they were within certain
    parameters.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">synthetic.conf</code> is intended to be used for
    creating mount points at <i class="Em">/</i> (e.g. for use as NFS mount
    points in enterprise deployments) and symbolic links (e.g. for creating a
    package manager root without modifying the system volume).
    <code class="Nm">synthetic.conf</code> is read by
    <a class="Xr">apfs.util(8)</a> during early system boot.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="FORMAT"><a class="permalink" href="#FORMAT">FORMAT</a></h1>
<code class="Nm">synthetic.conf</code> specifies a single synthetic entity per
  line. Each line may have one or two columns, separated by a tab character. If
  a line has a single column, it denotes a virtual empty directory to be created
  at <i class="Em">/</i>. If a line has two columns, it denotes a symbolic link
  at / whose link target is given in the second column.
<p class="Pp">In either case, the first column denotes the name of the entity to
    be created at <i class="Em">/</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">A line beginning with the <i class="Em">#</i> character indicates
    a comment that is not parsed.</p>

  ENTITIES</a></h1>
Synthetic entities may not be deleted at runtime. In order to delete a synthetic
  entity, it must be removed from <code class="Nm">synthetic.conf</code>, and
  the host must be rebooted.
<p class="Pp">New files and directories may not be created within a synthetic
    empty directory.</p>
