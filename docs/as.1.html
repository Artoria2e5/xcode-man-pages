The <i>as</i> command translates assembly code in the named files to object
  code. If no files are specified, <i>as</i> reads from <b>stdin</b>. All
  undefined symbols in the assembly are treated as global. The output of the
  assembly is left in the file <b>a.out</b> by default.
<p class="Pp">The program <b>/usr/bin/as</b> is actually a driver that executes
    assemblers for specific target architectures. If no target architecture is
    specified, it defaults to the architecture of the host it is running on.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-o</b><i> name</i></dt>
  <dd>Name the output file <i>name</i> instead of <b>a.out</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-arch</b><i> arch_type</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the target architecture, <i>arch_type</i>, of the assembler to
      be executed. The target assemblers for each architecture are in
      <b>/usr/libexec/gcc/darwin/</b><i>arch_type</i><b>/as</b> or
      <b>/usr/local/libexec/gcc/darwin/</b><i>arch_type</i><b>/as</b><i>.</i>
      There is only one assembler for an architecture family. If the specified
      target architecture is a machine-specific implementation, the assembler
      for that architecture family is executed (e.g.,
      <b>/usr/libexec/gcc/darwin/ppc/as</b> for <b>-arch ppc604e</b>). See
      <i>arch</i>(3) for the currently known <i>arch_type</i>s.</dd>
  <dt><b>-arch_multiple</b></dt>
  <dd>Precede any displayed messages with a line stating the program name
      (<b>as</b>) and the architecture (from the <b>-arch</b><i> arch_type</i>
      flag), to distinguish which architecture the error messages refer to. When
      the <i>cc</i>(1) driver program is run with multiple <b>-arch</b> flags,
      it invokes <i>as</i> with the <b>-arch_multiple</b> option.</dd>
  <dt><b>-force_cpusubtype_ALL</b></dt>
  <dd>By default, the assembler will produce the CPU subtype ALL for the object
      file it is assembling if it finds no implementation-specific instructions.
      Also by default, the assembler will allow implementation-specific
      instructions and will combine the CPU subtype for those specific
      implementations. The combining of specific implementations is
      architecture-dependent; if some combination of instructions is not
      allowed, an error is generated. With the optional
      <b>-force_cpusubtype_ALL</b> flag, all instructions are allowed and the
      object file's CPU subtype will be the ALL subtype. If the target
      architecture specified is a machine-specific implementation (e.g.,
      <b>-arch ppc603</b>, <b>-arch i486</b>), the assembler will flag as errors
      instructions that are not supported on that architecture, and it will
      produce an object file with the CPU subtype for that specific
      implementation (even if no implementation-specific instructions are used).
      The <b>-force_cpusubtype_ALL</b> flag is the default for all x86 and
      x86_64 architectures.</dd>
  <dt><b>-dynamic</b></dt>
  <dd>Enables dynamic linking features. This is the default.</dd>
  <dt><b>-static</b></dt>
  <dd>Causes the assembler to treat as an error any features for dynamic
      linking. Also causes the .text directive to not include the
      pure_instructions section attribute.</dd>
  <dt><b>--</b></dt>
  <dd>Use <b>stdin</b> for the assembly source input.</dd>
  <dt><b>-n</b></dt>
  <dd>Instructs the assembler not to assume that the assembly file starts with a
      <b>.text</b> directive. Use this option when an output file is not to
      contain a (__TEXT,__text) section or this section is not to be first one
      in the output file.</dd>
  <dt><b>-f</b></dt>
  <dd>Fast; no need for the assembler preprocessor (``app''). The assembler
      preprocessor can also be turned off by starting the assembly file with
      &quot;#NO_APP\n&quot;. This is intended for use by compilers which produce
      assembly code in a strict &quot;clean&quot; format that specifies exactly
      where whitespace can go. The assembler preprocessor needs to be run on
      hand-written assembly files and/or files that have been preprocessed by
      the C preprocessor <b>cpp.</b> This is typically needed when assembler
      files are assembled through the use of the <i>cc</i>(1) command, which
      automatically runs the C preprocessor on assembly source files. The
      assembler preprocessor strips out excess spaces, turns single-quoted
      characters into a decimal constants, and turns # &lt;number&gt;
      &lt;filename&gt; &lt;level&gt; into .line &lt;number&gt;;.file
      &lt;filename&gt; pairs. When the assembler preprocessor has been turned
      off by a &quot;#NO_APP\n&quot; at the start of a file, it can be turned
      back on and off again with pairs of &quot;#APP\n&quot; and
      &quot;#NO_APP\n&quot; at the beginnings of lines. This is used by the
      compiler to wrap assembly statements produced from <b>asm()</b>
      statements.</dd>
  <dt><b>-g</b></dt>
  <dd>Produce debugging information for the symbolic debugger <i>gdb</i>(1) so
      that the assembly source can be debugged symbolically. The debugger
      depends on correct use of the C preprocessor's #include directive or the
      assembler's .include directive: Any include file that produces
      instructions in the (__TEXT,__text) section must be included while a .text
      directive is in effect. In other words, there must be a .text directive
      before the include, and the .text directive must still be in effect at the
      end of the include file. Otherwise, the debugger will get confused when in
      that assembly file.</dd>
  <dt><b>-v</b></dt>
  <dd>Display the version of the assembler (both the Mac OS X version and the
      GNU version it is based on).</dd>
  <dt><b>-V</b></dt>
  <dd>Print the path and the command line of the assembler the assembler driver
      is using.</dd>
  <dt><b>-I</b><i>dir</i></dt>
  <dd>Add the directory <i>dir</i> to the list of directories to search for
      files included with the .include directive. The default place to search is
      the current directory.</dd>
  <dt><b>-W</b></dt>
  <dd>Suppress warnings.</dd>
  <dt><b>-L</b></dt>
  <dd>Save non-global defined labels beginning with an 'L'; these labels are
      normally discarded to save space in the resultant symbol table. The
      compiler generates such temporary labels.</dd>
  <dt><b>-q</b></dt>
  <dd>Use the <i>clang</i>(1) integrated assembler instead of the GNU based
      system assembler. This is the default for the x86 and arm
    architectures.</dd>
  <dt><b>-Q</b></dt>
  <dd>Use the GNU based system assembler. Note that Apple's built-in system
      assemblers are deprecated; programs that rely on these asssemblers should
      move to the <i>clang</i>(1) integrated assembler instead, using the
      <b>-q</b> flag.</dd>

  <dd>Treat a single trailing '+' or '-' after a conditional PowerPC branch
      instruction as a static branch prediction that sets the Y-bit in the

      AT-bits. This is the default for Mac OS X.</dd>

      instruction as a static branch prediction that sets the AT-bits in the
