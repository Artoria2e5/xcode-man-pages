Runs a number of housekeeping tasks within the current repository, such as
  compressing file revisions (to reduce disk space and increase performance),
  removing unreachable objects which may have been created from prior
  invocations of <i>git add</i>, packing refs, pruning reflog, rerere metadata
  or stale working trees. May also update ancillary indexes such as the
  commit-graph.
<p class="Pp">Users are encouraged to run this task on a regular basis within
    each repository to maintain good disk space utilization and good operating
    performance.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some git commands may automatically run <i>git gc</i>; see the
    <b>--auto</b> flag below for details. If you know what you&#x2019;re doing
    and all you want is to disable this behavior permanently without further
    considerations, just do:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git config --global gc.auto 0
</pre>
</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
--aggressive
<div class="Bd-indent">Usually <i>git gc</i> runs very quickly while providing
  good disk space utilization and performance. This option will cause <i>git
  gc</i> to more aggressively optimize the repository at the expense of taking
  much more time. The effects of this optimization are persistent, so this
  option only needs to be used occasionally; every few hundred changesets or
  so.</div>
<p class="Pp">--auto</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">With this option, <i>git gc</i> checks whether any
  housekeeping is required; if not, it exits without performing any work. Some
  git commands run <b>git gc --auto</b> after performing operations that could
  create many loose objects. Housekeeping is required if there are too many
  loose objects or too many packs in the repository.
<p class="Pp">If the number of loose objects exceeds the value of the
    <b>gc.auto</b> configuration variable, then all loose objects are combined
    into a single pack using <b>git repack -d -l</b>. Setting the value of
    <b>gc.auto</b> to 0 disables automatic packing of loose objects.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the number of packs exceeds the value of
    <b>gc.autoPackLimit</b>, then existing packs (except those marked with a
    <b>.keep</b> file or over <b>gc.bigPackThreshold</b> limit) are consolidated
    into a single pack by using the <b>-A</b> option of <i>git repack</i>. If
    the amount of memory is estimated not enough for <b>git repack</b> to run
    smoothly and <b>gc.bigPackThreshold</b> is not set, the largest pack will
    also be excluded (this is the equivalent of running <b>git gc</b> with
    <b>--keep-base-pack</b>). Setting <b>gc.autoPackLimit</b> to 0 disables
    automatic consolidation of packs.</p>
<p class="Pp">If houskeeping is required due to many loose objects or packs, all
    other housekeeping tasks (e.g. rerere, working trees, reflog...) will be
    performed as well.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--prune=&lt;date&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Prune loose objects older than date (default is 2 weeks
  ago, overridable by the config variable <b>gc.pruneExpire</b>). --prune=all
  prunes loose objects regardless of their age and increases the risk of
  corruption if another process is writing to the repository concurrently; see
  &quot;NOTES&quot; below. --prune is on by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-prune</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not prune any loose objects.</div>
<p class="Pp">--quiet</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Suppress all progress reports.</div>
<p class="Pp">--force</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Force <b>git gc</b> to run even if there may be another
  <b>git gc</b> instance running on this repository.</div>
<p class="Pp">--keep-largest-pack</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">All packs except the largest pack and those marked with a
  <b>.keep</b> files are consolidated into a single pack. When this option is
  used, <b>gc.bigPackThreshold</b> is ignored.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="permalink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
The optional configuration variable <b>gc.reflogExpire</b> can be set to
  indicate how long historical entries within each branch&#x2019;s reflog should
  remain available in this repository. The setting is expressed as a length of
  time, for example <i>90 days</i> or <i>3 months</i>. It defaults to <i>90
  days</i>.
<p class="Pp">The optional configuration variable
    <b>gc.reflogExpireUnreachable</b> can be set to indicate how long historical
    reflog entries which are not part of the current branch should remain
    available in this repository. These types of entries are generally created
    as a result of using <b>git commit --amend</b> or <b>git rebase</b> and are
    the commits prior to the amend or rebase occurring. Since these changes are
    not part of the current project most users will want to expire them sooner.
    This option defaults to <i>30 days</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The above two configuration variables can be given to a pattern.
    For example, this sets non-default expiry values only to remote-tracking
    branches:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
[gc &quot;refs/remotes/*&quot;]
        reflogExpire = never
        reflogExpireUnreachable = 3 days
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The optional configuration variable <b>gc.rerereResolved</b>
    indicates how long records of conflicted merge you resolved earlier are
    kept. This defaults to 60 days.</p>
<p class="Pp">The optional configuration variable <b>gc.rerereUnresolved</b>
    indicates how long records of conflicted merge you have not resolved are
    kept. This defaults to 15 days.</p>
<p class="Pp">The optional configuration variable <b>gc.packRefs</b> determines
    if <i>git gc</i> runs <i>git pack-refs</i>. This can be set to
    &quot;notbare&quot; to enable it within all non-bare repos or it can be set
    to a boolean value. This defaults to true.</p>
<p class="Pp">The optional configuration variable <b>gc.writeCommitGraph</b>
    determines if <i>git gc</i> should run <i>git commit-graph write</i>. This
    can be set to a boolean value. This defaults to false.</p>
<p class="Pp">The optional configuration variable <b>gc.aggressiveWindow</b>
    controls how much time is spent optimizing the delta compression of the
    objects in the repository when the --aggressive option is specified. The
    larger the value, the more time is spent optimizing the delta compression.
    See the documentation for the --window option in <b>git-repack</b>(1) for
    more details. This defaults to 250.</p>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, the optional configuration variable
    <b>gc.aggressiveDepth</b> controls --depth option in <b>git-repack</b>(1).
    This defaults to 50.</p>
<p class="Pp">The optional configuration variable <b>gc.pruneExpire</b> controls
    how old the unreferenced loose objects have to be before they are pruned.
    The default is &quot;2 weeks ago&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Optional configuration variable <b>gc.worktreePruneExpire</b>
    controls how old a stale working tree should be before <b>git worktree
    prune</b> deletes it. Default is &quot;3 months ago&quot;.</p>

<i>git gc</i> tries very hard not to delete objects that are referenced anywhere
  in your repository. In particular, it will keep not only objects referenced by
  your current set of branches and tags, but also objects referenced by the
  index, remote-tracking branches, refs saved by <i>git filter-branch</i> in
  refs/original/, or reflogs (which may reference commits in branches that were
  later amended or rewound). If you are expecting some objects to be deleted and
  they aren&#x2019;t, check all of those locations and decide whether it makes
  sense in your case to remove those references.
<p class="Pp">On the other hand, when <i>git gc</i> runs concurrently with
    another process, there is a risk of it deleting an object that the other
    process is using but hasn&#x2019;t created a reference to. This may just
    cause the other process to fail or may corrupt the repository if the other
    process later adds a reference to the deleted object. Git has two features
    that significantly mitigate this problem:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.Any object with modification time newer than the
  <b>--prune</b> date is kept, along with everything reachable from it.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.Most operations that add an object to the database
  update the modification time of the object if it is already present so that #1
  applies.</div>
<p class="Pp">However, these features fall short of a complete solution, so
    users who run commands concurrently have to live with some risk of
    corruption (which seems to be low in practice) unless they turn off
    automatic garbage collection with <i>git config gc.auto 0</i>.</p>
