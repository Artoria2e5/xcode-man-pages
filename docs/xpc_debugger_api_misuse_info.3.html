The XPC API will aggressively defend itself against perceived misuse. Wherever
  XPC can definitively detect misuse of its APIs or data corruption, it will
  abort. For example, if the retain count of an object underflows by calling
  <a class="Xr">xpc_release(3)</a> on it too many times, XPC will abort the
  process.
<p class="Pp">Many frameworks opt to keep the program limping along in such a
    state (and will perhaps print a warning message to the system log), but
    aborting upon detection provides unmistakable warning that there is a bug
    present in the application which should be fixed before shipping.</p>
<p class="Pp">When XPC aborts a process, it will place information about the
    condition which triggered the abort in the <i class="Em">Application
    Specific Information</i> section of the crash report. The message will be
    human-readable, prefixed with &quot;XPC API Misuse:&quot;, and the crash
    report will indicate the stack trace which caused the abort.</p>
<p class="Pp">XPC will also abort if it detects unrecoverable data corruption in
    its internal state. The messages for these conditions will be prefixd with
    &quot;Bug in libxpc:&quot;. If you come across such a crash, please file a
    bug and include the generated crash log, system log and steps to reproduce
    (if there are any identifiable steps).</p>
<p class="Pp">Currently, the manner in which XPC aborts the process will result
    in termination due to SIGILL (illegal instruction). The exact signal raised
    may change from release to release (or platform to platform). But on OS X
    Lion, SIGILL may be used as a hint that the process was terminated
    intentionally.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DEBUGGING"><a class="permalink" href="#DEBUGGING">DEBUGGING</a></h1>
When debugging in Xcode or at the gdb command prompt, the debugger acts as the
  exception handler for the process being debugged. As a result, if the process
  is aborted by XPC, no crash report will be generated, and thus it may not be
  obvious why the program was terminated.
<p class="Pp">As mentioned before, SIGILL is an indication that the process was
    terminated intentionally. If you observe the last frame in the crashing
    stack to be <code class="Fn">_xpc_api_misuse</code>(), you may use the
    <code class="Fn">xpc_debugger_api_misuse_info</code>() API from within the
    debugger to obtain a human-readable string describing why the process was
    aborted. For example:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>
Program received signal EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION, Illegal instruction/operand.
0x000000010012b25e in _xpc_api_misuse ()
(gdb) p (char *)xpc_debugger_api_misuse_info()
$1 = 0x7fff5fbff908 &quot;XPC API Misuse: Over-release of object.&quot;
(gdb)
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This message indicates that <a class="Xr">xpc_release(3)</a> was
    called too many times on an object.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i class="Em">IMPORTANT</i>: The
    <code class="Fn">xpc_debugger_api_misuse_info</code>() API can ONLY be
    called from within a debugger. It is not meant to be called directly from
    the program. Do not call it directly from your code, and do not rely on the
    address of the result for any reason.</p>
