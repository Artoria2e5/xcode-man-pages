Hooks are programs you can place in a hooks directory to trigger actions at
  certain points in git&#x2019;s execution. Hooks that don&#x2019;t have the
  executable bit set are ignored.
<p class="Pp">By default the hooks directory is <b>$GIT_DIR/hooks</b>, but that
    can be changed via the <b>core.hooksPath</b> configuration variable (see
    <b>git-config</b>(1)).</p>
<p class="Pp">Before Git invokes a hook, it changes its working directory to
    either $GIT_DIR in a bare repository or the root of the working tree in a
    non-bare repository. An exception are hooks triggered during a push
    (<i>pre-receive</i>, <i>update</i>, <i>post-receive</i>, <i>post-update</i>,
    <i>push-to-checkout</i>) which are always executed in $GIT_DIR.</p>
<p class="Pp">Hooks can get their arguments via the environment, command-line
    arguments, and stdin. See the documentation for each hook below for
  details.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>git init</b> may copy hooks to the new repository, depending on
    its configuration. See the &quot;TEMPLATE DIRECTORY&quot; section in
    <b>git-init</b>(1) for details. When the rest of this document refers to
    &quot;default hooks&quot; it&#x2019;s talking about the default template
    shipped with Git.</p>
<p class="Pp">The currently supported hooks are described below.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="HOOKS"><a class="permalink" href="#HOOKS">HOOKS</a></h1>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="applypatch_-msg"><a class="permalink" href="#applypatch_-msg">applypatch-msg</a></h2>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-am</b>(1). It takes a single parameter, the name
  of the file that holds the proposed commit log message. Exiting with a
  non-zero status causes <b>git am</b> to abort before applying the patch.
<p class="Pp">The hook is allowed to edit the message file in place, and can be
    used to normalize the message into some project standard format. It can also
    be used to refuse the commit after inspecting the message file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default <i>applypatch-msg</i> hook, when enabled, runs the
    <i>commit-msg</i> hook, if the latter is enabled.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="pre_-applypatch"><a class="permalink" href="#pre_-applypatch">pre-applypatch</a></h2>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-am</b>(1). It takes no parameter, and is invoked
  after the patch is applied, but before a commit is made.
<p class="Pp">If it exits with non-zero status, then the working tree will not
    be committed after applying the patch.</p>
<p class="Pp">It can be used to inspect the current working tree and refuse to
    make a commit if it does not pass certain test.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default <i>pre-applypatch</i> hook, when enabled, runs the
    <i>pre-commit</i> hook, if the latter is enabled.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="post_-applypatch"><a class="permalink" href="#post_-applypatch">post-applypatch</a></h2>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-am</b>(1). It takes no parameter, and is invoked
  after the patch is applied and a commit is made.
<p class="Pp">This hook is meant primarily for notification, and cannot affect
    the outcome of <b>git am</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="pre_-commit"><a class="permalink" href="#pre_-commit">pre-commit</a></h2>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-commit</b>(1), and can be bypassed with the
  <b>--no-verify</b> option. It takes no parameters, and is invoked before
  obtaining the proposed commit log message and making a commit. Exiting with a
  non-zero status from this script causes the <b>git commit</b> command to abort
  before creating a commit.
<p class="Pp">The default <i>pre-commit</i> hook, when enabled, catches
    introduction of lines with trailing whitespaces and aborts the commit when
    such a line is found.</p>
<p class="Pp">All the <b>git commit</b> hooks are invoked with the environment
    variable <b>GIT_EDITOR=:</b> if the command will not bring up an editor to
    modify the commit message.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="prepare_-commit_-msg"><a class="permalink" href="#prepare_-commit_-msg">prepare-commit-msg</a></h2>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-commit</b>(1) right after preparing the default
  log message, and before the editor is started.
<p class="Pp">It takes one to three parameters. The first is the name of the
    file that contains the commit log message. The second is the source of the
    commit message, and can be: <b>message</b> (if a <b>-m</b> or <b>-F</b>
    option was given); <b>template</b> (if a <b>-t</b> option was given or the
    configuration option <b>commit.template</b> is set); <b>merge</b> (if the
    commit is a merge or a <b>.git/MERGE_MSG</b> file exists); <b>squash</b> (if
    a <b>.git/SQUASH_MSG</b> file exists); or <b>commit</b>, followed by a
    commit SHA-1 (if a <b>-c</b>, <b>-C</b> or <b>--amend</b> option was
  given).</p>
<p class="Pp">If the exit status is non-zero, <b>git commit</b> will abort.</p>
<p class="Pp">The purpose of the hook is to edit the message file in place, and
    it is not suppressed by the <b>--no-verify</b> option. A non-zero exit means
    a failure of the hook and aborts the commit. It should not be used as
    replacement for pre-commit hook.</p>
<p class="Pp">The sample <b>prepare-commit-msg</b> hook that comes with Git
    removes the help message found in the commented portion of the commit
    template.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="commit_-msg"><a class="permalink" href="#commit_-msg">commit-msg</a></h2>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-commit</b>(1) and <b>git-merge</b>(1), and can be
  bypassed with the <b>--no-verify</b> option. It takes a single parameter, the
  name of the file that holds the proposed commit log message. Exiting with a
  non-zero status causes the command to abort.
<p class="Pp">The hook is allowed to edit the message file in place, and can be
    used to normalize the message into some project standard format. It can also
    be used to refuse the commit after inspecting the message file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default <i>commit-msg</i> hook, when enabled, detects
    duplicate &quot;Signed-off-by&quot; lines, and aborts the commit if one is
    found.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="post_-commit"><a class="permalink" href="#post_-commit">post-commit</a></h2>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-commit</b>(1). It takes no parameters, and is
  invoked after a commit is made.
<p class="Pp">This hook is meant primarily for notification, and cannot affect
    the outcome of <b>git commit</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="pre_-rebase"><a class="permalink" href="#pre_-rebase">pre-rebase</a></h2>
This hook is called by <b>git-rebase</b>(1) and can be used to prevent a branch
  from getting rebased. The hook may be called with one or two parameters. The
  first parameter is the upstream from which the series was forked. The second
  parameter is the branch being rebased, and is not set when rebasing the
  current branch.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="post_-checkout"><a class="permalink" href="#post_-checkout">post-checkout</a></h2>
This hook is invoked when a <b>git-checkout</b>(1) is run after having updated
  the worktree. The hook is given three parameters: the ref of the previous
  HEAD, the ref of the new HEAD (which may or may not have changed), and a flag
  indicating whether the checkout was a branch checkout (changing branches,
  flag=1) or a file checkout (retrieving a file from the index, flag=0). This
  hook cannot affect the outcome of <b>git checkout</b>.
<p class="Pp">It is also run after <b>git-clone</b>(1), unless the
    <b>--no-checkout</b> (<b>-n</b>) option is used. The first parameter given
    to the hook is the null-ref, the second the ref of the new HEAD and the flag
    is always 1. Likewise for <b>git worktree add</b> unless
    <b>--no-checkout</b> is used.</p>
<p class="Pp">This hook can be used to perform repository validity checks,
    auto-display differences from the previous HEAD if different, or set working
    dir metadata properties.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="post_-merge"><a class="permalink" href="#post_-merge">post-merge</a></h2>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-merge</b>(1), which happens when a <b>git
  pull</b> is done on a local repository. The hook takes a single parameter, a
  status flag specifying whether or not the merge being done was a squash merge.
  This hook cannot affect the outcome of <b>git merge</b> and is not executed,
  if the merge failed due to conflicts.
<p class="Pp">This hook can be used in conjunction with a corresponding
    pre-commit hook to save and restore any form of metadata associated with the
    working tree (e.g.: permissions/ownership, ACLS, etc). See
    contrib/hooks/setgitperms.perl for an example of how to do this.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="pre_-push"><a class="permalink" href="#pre_-push">pre-push</a></h2>
This hook is called by <b>git-push</b>(1) and can be used to prevent a push from
  taking place. The hook is called with two parameters which provide the name
  and location of the destination remote, if a named remote is not being used
  both values will be the same.
<p class="Pp">Information about what is to be pushed is provided on the
    hook&#x2019;s standard input with lines of the form:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
&lt;local ref&gt; SP &lt;local sha1&gt; SP &lt;remote ref&gt; SP &lt;remote sha1&gt; LF
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">For instance, if the command <b>git push origin master:foreign</b>
    were run the hook would receive a line like the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
refs/heads/master 67890 refs/heads/foreign 12345
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">although the full, 40-character SHA-1s would be supplied. If the
    foreign ref does not yet exist the <b>&lt;remote SHA-1&gt;</b> will be 40
    <b>0</b>. If a ref is to be deleted, the <b>&lt;local ref&gt;</b> will be
    supplied as <b>(delete)</b> and the <b>&lt;local SHA-1&gt;</b> will be 40
    <b>0</b>. If the local commit was specified by something other than a name
    which could be expanded (such as <b>HEAD~</b>, or a SHA-1) it will be
    supplied as it was originally given.</p>
<p class="Pp">If this hook exits with a non-zero status, <b>git push</b> will
    abort without pushing anything. Information about why the push is rejected
    may be sent to the user by writing to standard error.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="pre_-receive"><a class="permalink" href="#pre_-receive">pre-receive</a></h2>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-receive-pack</b>(1) when it reacts to <b>git
  push</b> and updates reference(s) in its repository. Just before starting to
  update refs on the remote repository, the pre-receive hook is invoked. Its
  exit status determines the success or failure of the update.
<p class="Pp">This hook executes once for the receive operation. It takes no
    arguments, but for each ref to be updated it receives on standard input a
    line of the format:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
&lt;old-value&gt; SP &lt;new-value&gt; SP &lt;ref-name&gt; LF
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">where <b>&lt;old-value&gt;</b> is the old object name stored in
    the ref, <b>&lt;new-value&gt;</b> is the new object name to be stored in the
    ref and <b>&lt;ref-name&gt;</b> is the full name of the ref. When creating a
    new ref, <b>&lt;old-value&gt;</b> is 40 <b>0</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the hook exits with non-zero status, none of the refs will be
    updated. If the hook exits with zero, updating of individual refs can still
    be prevented by the <i>update</i> hook.</p>
<p class="Pp">Both standard output and standard error output are forwarded to
    <b>git send-pack</b> on the other end, so you can simply <b>echo</b>
    messages for the user.</p>
<p class="Pp">The number of push options given on the command line of <b>git
    push --push-option=...</b> can be read from the environment variable
    <b>GIT_PUSH_OPTION_COUNT</b>, and the options themselves are found in
    <b>GIT_PUSH_OPTION_0</b>, <b>GIT_PUSH_OPTION_1</b>,... If it is negotiated
    to not use the push options phase, the environment variables will not be
    set. If the client selects to use push options, but doesn&#x2019;t transmit
    any, the count variable will be set to zero,
  <b>GIT_PUSH_OPTION_COUNT=0</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">See the section on &quot;Quarantine Environment&quot; in
    <b>git-receive-pack</b>(1) for some caveats.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="update"><a class="permalink" href="#update">update</a></h2>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-receive-pack</b>(1) when it reacts to <b>git
  push</b> and updates reference(s) in its repository. Just before updating the
  ref on the remote repository, the update hook is invoked. Its exit status
  determines the success or failure of the ref update.
<p class="Pp">The hook executes once for each ref to be updated, and takes three
    parameters:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;the name of the ref being updated,</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;the old object name stored in the ref,</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;and the new object name to be stored in the
  ref.</div>
<p class="Pp">A zero exit from the update hook allows the ref to be updated.
    Exiting with a non-zero status prevents <b>git receive-pack</b> from
    updating that ref.</p>
<p class="Pp">This hook can be used to prevent <i>forced</i> update on certain
    refs by making sure that the object name is a commit object that is a
    descendant of the commit object named by the old object name. That is, to
    enforce a &quot;fast-forward only&quot; policy.</p>
<p class="Pp">It could also be used to log the old..new status. However, it does
    not know the entire set of branches, so it would end up firing one e-mail
    per ref when used naively, though. The <i>post-receive</i> hook is more
    suited to that.</p>
<p class="Pp">In an environment that restricts the users' access only to git
    commands over the wire, this hook can be used to implement access control
    without relying on filesystem ownership and group membership. See
    <b>git-shell</b>(1) for how you might use the login shell to restrict the
    user&#x2019;s access to only git commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">Both standard output and standard error output are forwarded to
    <b>git send-pack</b> on the other end, so you can simply <b>echo</b>
    messages for the user.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default <i>update</i> hook, when enabled&#x2014;and with
    <b>hooks.allowunannotated</b> config option unset or set to
    false&#x2014;prevents unannotated tags to be pushed.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="post_-receive"><a class="permalink" href="#post_-receive">post-receive</a></h2>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-receive-pack</b>(1) when it reacts to <b>git
  push</b> and updates reference(s) in its repository. It executes on the remote
  repository once after all the refs have been updated.
<p class="Pp">This hook executes once for the receive operation. It takes no
    arguments, but gets the same information as the <i>pre-receive</i> hook does
    on its standard input.</p>
<p class="Pp">This hook does not affect the outcome of <b>git receive-pack</b>,
    as it is called after the real work is done.</p>
<p class="Pp">This supersedes the <i>post-update</i> hook in that it gets both
    old and new values of all the refs in addition to their names.</p>
<p class="Pp">Both standard output and standard error output are forwarded to
    <b>git send-pack</b> on the other end, so you can simply <b>echo</b>
    messages for the user.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default <i>post-receive</i> hook is empty, but there is a
    sample script <b>post-receive-email</b> provided in the <b>contrib/hooks</b>
    directory in Git distribution, which implements sending commit emails.</p>
<p class="Pp">The number of push options given on the command line of <b>git
    push --push-option=...</b> can be read from the environment variable
    <b>GIT_PUSH_OPTION_COUNT</b>, and the options themselves are found in
    <b>GIT_PUSH_OPTION_0</b>, <b>GIT_PUSH_OPTION_1</b>,... If it is negotiated
    to not use the push options phase, the environment variables will not be
    set. If the client selects to use push options, but doesn&#x2019;t transmit
    any, the count variable will be set to zero,
  <b>GIT_PUSH_OPTION_COUNT=0</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="post_-update"><a class="permalink" href="#post_-update">post-update</a></h2>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-receive-pack</b>(1) when it reacts to <b>git
  push</b> and updates reference(s) in its repository. It executes on the remote
  repository once after all the refs have been updated.
<p class="Pp">It takes a variable number of parameters, each of which is the
    name of ref that was actually updated.</p>
<p class="Pp">This hook is meant primarily for notification, and cannot affect
    the outcome of <b>git receive-pack</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>post-update</i> hook can tell what are the heads that were
    pushed, but it does not know what their original and updated values are, so
    it is a poor place to do log old..new. The <i>post-receive</i> hook does get
    both original and updated values of the refs. You might consider it instead
    if you need them.</p>
<p class="Pp">When enabled, the default <i>post-update</i> hook runs <b>git
    update-server-info</b> to keep the information used by dumb transports
    (e.g., HTTP) up to date. If you are publishing a Git repository that is
    accessible via HTTP, you should probably enable this hook.</p>
<p class="Pp">Both standard output and standard error output are forwarded to
    <b>git send-pack</b> on the other end, so you can simply <b>echo</b>
    messages for the user.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="push_-to_-checkout"><a class="permalink" href="#push_-to_-checkout">push-to-checkout</a></h2>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-receive-pack</b>(1) when it reacts to <b>git
  push</b> and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push tries
  to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
  <b>receive.denyCurrentBranch</b> configuration variable is set to
  <b>updateInstead</b>. Such a push by default is refused if the working tree
  and the index of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
  checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match the current
  commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip of the branch. This
  hook is to be used to override the default behaviour.
<p class="Pp">The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
    branch is going to be updated. It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse
    the push (when it does so, it must not modify the index or the working
    tree). Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
    index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current branch
    is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, the hook can simply run <b>git read-tree -u -m HEAD
    &quot;$1&quot;</b> in order to emulate <b>git fetch</b> that is run in the
    reverse direction with <b>git push</b>, as the two-tree form of <b>git
    read-tree -u -m</b> is essentially the same as <b>git checkout</b> that
    switches branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that
    do not interfere with the difference between the branches.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="pre_-auto_-gc"><a class="permalink" href="#pre_-auto_-gc">pre-auto-gc</a></h2>
This hook is invoked by <b>git gc --auto</b> (see <b>git-gc</b>(1)). It takes no
  parameter, and exiting with non-zero status from this script causes the <b>git
  gc --auto</b> to abort.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="post_-rewrite"><a class="permalink" href="#post_-rewrite">post-rewrite</a></h2>
This hook is invoked by commands that rewrite commits (<b>git-commit</b>(1) when
  called with <b>--amend</b> and <b>git-rebase</b>(1); currently <b>git
  filter-branch</b> does <i>not</i> call it!). Its first argument denotes the
  command it was invoked by: currently one of <b>amend</b> or <b>rebase</b>.
  Further command-dependent arguments may be passed in the future.
<p class="Pp">The hook receives a list of the rewritten commits on stdin, in the
    format</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
&lt;old-sha1&gt; SP &lt;new-sha1&gt; [ SP &lt;extra-info&gt; ] LF
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <i>extra-info</i> is again command-dependent. If it is empty,
    the preceding SP is also omitted. Currently, no commands pass any
    <i>extra-info</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The hook always runs after the automatic note copying (see
    &quot;notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;&quot; in <b>git-config</b>(1)) has
    happened, and thus has access to these notes.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following command-specific comments apply:</p>
<p class="Pp">rebase</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">For the <i>squash</i> and <i>fixup</i> operation, all
  commits that were squashed are listed as being rewritten to the squashed
  commit. This means that there will be several lines sharing the same
  <i>new-sha1</i>.
<p class="Pp">The commits are guaranteed to be listed in the order that they
    were processed by rebase.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="sendemail_-validate"><a class="permalink" href="#sendemail_-validate">sendemail-validate</a></h2>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-send-email</b>(1). It takes a single parameter,
  the name of the file that holds the e-mail to be sent. Exiting with a non-zero
  status causes <b>git send-email</b> to abort before sending any e-mails.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="fsmonitor_-watchman"><a class="permalink" href="#fsmonitor_-watchman">fsmonitor-watchman</a></h2>
This hook is invoked when the configuration option <b>core.fsmonitor</b> is set
  to <b>.git/hooks/fsmonitor-watchman</b>. It takes two arguments, a version
  (currently 1) and the time in elapsed nanoseconds since midnight, January 1,
  1970.
<p class="Pp">The hook should output to stdout the list of all files in the
    working directory that may have changed since the requested time. The logic
    should be inclusive so that it does not miss any potential changes. The
    paths should be relative to the root of the working directory and be
    separated by a single NUL.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is OK to include files which have not actually changed. All
    changes including newly-created and deleted files should be included. When
    files are renamed, both the old and the new name should be included.</p>
<p class="Pp">Git will limit what files it checks for changes as well as which
    directories are checked for untracked files based on the path names
  given.</p>
<p class="Pp">An optimized way to tell git &quot;all files have changed&quot; is
    to return the filename <b>/</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The exit status determines whether git will use the data from the
    hook to limit its search. On error, it will fall back to verifying all files
    and folders.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="p4_-pre_-submit"><a class="permalink" href="#p4_-pre_-submit">p4-pre-submit</a></h2>
This hook is invoked by <b>git-p4 submit</b>. It takes no parameters and nothing
  from standard input. Exiting with non-zero status from this script prevent
  <b>git-p4 submit</b> from launching. Run <b>git-p4 submit --help</b> for
  details.
