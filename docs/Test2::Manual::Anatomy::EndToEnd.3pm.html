<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>$!, $@, $? and $^E are captured and preserved.</dt>
  <dd>Test2 makes a point to preserve the values of $!, $@, $? and $^E such that
      the test tools do not modify these variables unexpectedly. They are
      captured first thing so that they can be restored later.</dd>
  <dt>The API state is changed to 'loaded'.</dt>
  <dd>The 'loaded' state means that test tools have already started running.
      This is important as some plugins need to take effect before any tests are
      run. This state change only happens the first time a context is acquired,
      and may trigger some hooks defined by plugins to run.</dd>
  <dt>The current hub is found.</dt>
  <dd>A context attaches itself to the current Test2::Hub. If there is no
      current hub then the root hub will be initialized. This will also
      initialize the hub stack if necessary.</dd>
  <dt>Context acquire hooks fire.</dt>
  <dd>It is possible to create global, or hub-specific hooks that fire whenever
      a context is acquired, these hooks will fire now. These hooks fire even if
      there is an existing context.</dd>
  <dt>Any existing context is found.</dt>
  <dd>If the current hub already has a context then a clone of it will be used
      instead of a completely new context. This is important because it allows
      nested tools to inherit the context used by parent tools.</dd>
  <dt>Stack depth is measured.</dt>
  <dd>Test2 makes a point to catch mistakes in how the context is used. The
      stack depth is used to accomplish this. If there is an existing context
      the depth will be checked against the one found here. If the old context
      has the same stack depth, or a shallower one, it means a tool is
      misbehaving and did not clean up the context when it was done, in which
      case the old context will be cleaned up, and a warning issued.</dd>
  <dt>A new context is created (if no existing context was found)</dt>
  <dd>If there is no existing context, a new one will be created using the data
      collected so far.</dd>
  <dt>Context init hooks fire (if no existing context was found)</dt>
  <dd>If a new context was created, context-creation hooks will fire.</dd>
  <dt>$!, $@, $?, and $^E are restored.</dt>
  <dd>We make sure $!, $@, $?, and $^E are unchanged at this point so that
      changes we made will not effect anything else. This is done in case
      something inside the context construction accidentally changed these
    vars.</dd>
  <dt>The context is returned.</dt>
  <dd>You have a shiney new context object, or a clone of the existing
    context.</dd>

  <dt>The Test2::Event::Ok module is loaded.</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;send_event()&quot;</span> method will

      <span class="Li">&quot;send_event()&quot;</span> will assume the first
      argument is an event class without the
      <span class="Li">&quot;Test2::Event::&quot;</span> prefix, which it will
      add for you. If you want to use an event class that is in a different
      namespace you can prefix the class name with a
      <span class="Li">&quot;+&quot;</span> to tell the tool that you are giving
      a fully qualified class name:

  <dd>The event object is instantiated using the provided parameters.</dd>
  <dt>The event object is sent to the hub.</dt>
  <dd>The hub takes over from here.</dd>
  <dt>The hub runs the event through any filters.</dt>
  <dd>Filters are able to modify or remove events. Filters are run first, before
      the event can modify global test state.</dd>
  <dt>The global test state is updated to reflect the event.</dt>
  <dd>If the event effects test count then the count will be incremented. If the
      event causes failure then the failure count will be incremented. There are
      a couple other ways the global state can be effected as well.</dd>
  <dt>The event is sent to the formatter</dt>
  <dd>After the state is changed the hub will send the event to the formatter
      for rendering. This is where TAP is normally produced.</dd>
  <dt>The event is sent to all listeners.</dt>
  <dd>There can be any number of listeners that take action when events are
      processed, this happens now.</dd>

  <dt>If this was the canonical context, it will actually release</dt>
  <dd>When a context is created it is considered 'canon'. Any context obtained

  <dt>Release hooks are called</dt>
  <dd>Release hooks are the main motivation behind making the

      required action on the part of test tools. These are hooks that we can
      have called when a tool is complete. This is how plugins like
      Test2::Plugin::DieOnFail are implemented. If we simply had a destructor
      call the hooks then we would be unable to write this plugin as a
      <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span> inside of a destructor is
    useless.</dd>
  <dt>The context is cleared</dt>
  <dd>The main context data is cleared allowing the next tool to create a new

      number.</dd>

  HAPPENS WHEN A TEST SCRIPT IS DONE?</a></h1>
Test2 has some behaviors it runs in an <span class="Li">&quot;END { ...
  }&quot;</span> block after tests are done running. This end block does some
  final checks to warn you if something went wrong. This end block also sets the
  exit value of the script.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>API Versions are checked.</dt>
  <dd>A warning will be produced if Test::Builder is loaded, but has a different
      version compared to Test2::API. This situation can happen if you downgrade
      to an older Test-Simple distribution, and is a bad situation.</dd>
  <dt>Any remaining context objects are cleaned up.</dt>
  <dd>If there are leftover context objects they will need to be cleaned up. A
      leftover context is never a good thing, and usually requires a warning. A
      leftover context could also be the result of an exception being thrown
      which terminates the script, Test2 is fairly good at noticing this and not
      warning in these cases as the warning would simply be noise.</dd>
  <dt>Child processes are sent a 'waiting' event.</dt>
  <dd>If IPC is active, a waiting event is sent to all child processes.</dd>
  <dt>The script will wait for all child processes and/or threads to
    complete.</dt>
  <dd>This happens only when IPC is loaded, but Test::Builder is not. This
      behavior is useful, but would break compatibility for legacy tests.</dd>
  <dt>The hub stack is cleaned up.</dt>
  <dd>All hubs are finalized starting from the top. Leftover hubs are usually a
      bad thing, so a warning is produced if any are found.</dd>
  <dt>The root hub is finalized.</dt>
  <dd>This step is a no-op if <span class="Li">&quot;done_testing()&quot;</span>
      was used. If needed this will mark the root hub as finished.</dd>
  <dt>Exit callbacks are called.</dt>
  <dd>This is a chance for plugins to modify the final exit value of the
    script.</dd>
  <dt>The scripts exit value ($?) is set.</dt>
  <dd>If the test encountered any failures this will be set to a non-zero value.
      If possible this will be set to the number of failures, or 255 if the
      number is larger than 255 (the max value allowed).</dd>
  <dt>Broken module diagnostics</dt>
  <dd>Test2 is aware of many modules which were broken by Test2's release. At
      this point the script will check if any known-broken modules were loaded,
      and warn you if they were.
    <p class="Pp"><b>Note:</b> This only happens if there were test failures. No
        broken module warnings are produced on a success.</p>
