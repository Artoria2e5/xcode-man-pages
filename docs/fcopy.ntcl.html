   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location

  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)
  	Draw four-sided box normally, but don't draw top of
  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar
  	# Special macro to handle page bottom:  finish off current
  	# box/sidebar if in box/sidebar mode, then invoked standard
  	# page bottom macro.
  	Draw three-sided box if this is the box's first page,
  	draw two sides but no top otherwise.

fcopy - Copy data from one channel to another

The <b>fcopy</b> command copies data from one I/O channel, <i>inchan</i> to
  another I/O channel, <i>outchan</i>. The <b>fcopy</b> command leverages the
  buffering in the Tcl I/O system to avoid extra copies and to avoid buffering
  too much data in main memory when copying large files to slow destinations
  like network sockets.
<p class="Pp">The <b>fcopy</b> command transfers data from <i>inchan</i> until
    end of file or <i>size</i> bytes have been transferred. If no <b>-size</b>
    argument is given, then the copy goes until end of file. All the data read
    from <i>inchan</i> is copied to <i>outchan</i>. Without the <b>-command</b>
    option, <b>fcopy</b> blocks until the copy is complete and returns the
    number of bytes written to <i>outchan</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-command</b> argument makes <b>fcopy</b> work in the
    background. In this case it returns immediately and the <i>callback</i> is
    invoked later when the copy completes. The <i>callback</i> is called with
    one or two additional arguments that indicates how many bytes were written
    to <i>outchan</i>. If an error occurred during the background copy, the
    second argument is the error string associated with the error. With a
    background copy, it is not necessary to put <i>inchan</i> or <i>outchan</i>
    into non-blocking mode; the <b>fcopy</b> command takes care of that
    automatically. However, it is necessary to enter the event loop by using the
    <b>vwait</b> command or by using Tk.</p>
<p class="Pp">You are not allowed to do other I/O operations with <i>inchan</i>
    or <i>outchan</i> during a background <b>fcopy</b>. If either <i>inchan</i>
    or <i>outchan</i> get closed while the copy is in progress, the current copy
    is stopped and the command callback is <i>not</i> made. If <i>inchan</i> is
    closed, then all data already queued for <i>outchan</i> is written out.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that <i>inchan</i> can become readable during a background
    copy. You should turn off any <b>fileevent</b> handlers during a background
    copy so those handlers do not interfere with the copy. Any I/O attempted by
    a <b>fileevent</b> handler will get a &#x201C;channel busy&#x201D;
  error.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Fcopy</b> translates end-of-line sequences in <i>inchan</i> and
    <i>outchan</i> according to the <b>-translation</b> option for these
    channels. See the manual entry for <b>fconfigure</b> for details on the
    <b>-translation</b> option. The translations mean that the number of bytes
    read from <i>inchan</i> can be different than the number of bytes written to
    <i>outchan</i>. Only the number of bytes written to <i>outchan</i> is
    reported, either as the return value of a synchronous <b>fcopy</b> or as the
    argument to the callback for an asynchronous <b>fcopy</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Fcopy</b> obeys the encodings and character translations
    configured for the channels. This means that the incoming characters are
    converted internally first UTF-8 and then into the encoding of the channel
    <b>fcopy</b> writes to. See the manual entry for <b>fconfigure</b> for
    details on the <b>-encoding</b> and <b>-translation</b> options. No
    conversion is done if both channels are set to encoding
    &#x201C;binary&#x201D; and have matching translations. If only the output
    channel is set to encoding &#x201C;binary&#x201D; the system will write the
    internal UTF-8 representation of the incoming characters. If only the input
    channel is set to encoding &#x201C;binary&#x201D; the system will assume
    that the incoming bytes are valid UTF-8 characters and convert them
    according to the output encoding. The behaviour of the system for bytes
    which are not valid UTF-8 characters is undefined in this case.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
The first example transfers the contents of one channel exactly to another. Note
  that when copying one file to another, it is better to use <b>file copy</b>
  which also copies file metadata (e.g. the file access permissions) where
  possible.
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
fconfigure $in -translation binary
fconfigure $out -translation binary
<b>fcopy</b> $in $out
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This second example shows how the callback gets passed the number
    of bytes transferred. It also uses vwait to put the application into the
    event loop. Of course, this simplified example could be done without the
    command callback.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
proc Cleanup {in out bytes {error {}}} {
    global total
    set total $bytes
    close $in
    close $out
    if {[string length $error] != 0} {
	# error occurred during the copy
    }
}
set in [open $file1]
set out [socket $server $port]
<b>fcopy</b> $in $out -command [list Cleanup $in $out]
vwait total
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The third example copies in chunks and tests for end of file in
    the command callback</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
proc CopyMore {in out chunk bytes {error {}}} {
    global total done
    incr total $bytes
    if {([string length $error] != 0) || [eof $in]} {
	set done $total
	close $in
	close $out
    } else {
	<b>fcopy</b> $in $out -size $chunk \
                -command [list CopyMore $in $out $chunk]
    }
}
set in [open $file1]
set out [socket $server $port]
set chunk 1024
set total 0
<b>fcopy</b> $in $out -size $chunk \
        -command [list CopyMore $in $out $chunk]
vwait done
