This function is deprecated. Do not use! See <i>curl_mime_init(3)</i> instead!
<p class="Pp">curl_formadd() is used to append sections when building a
    multipart/formdata HTTP POST (sometimes referred to as RFC2388-style posts).
    Append one section at a time until you've added all the sections you want
    included and then you pass the <i>firstitem</i> pointer as parameter to
    <i>CURLOPT_HTTPPOST(3)</i>. <i>lastitem</i> is set after each
    <i>curl_formadd(3)</i> call and on repeated invokes it should be left as set
    to allow repeated invokes to find the end of the list faster.</p>
<p class="Pp">After the <i>lastitem</i> pointer follow the real arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">The pointers <i>firstitem</i> and <i>lastitem</i> should both be
    pointing to NULL in the first call to this function. All list-data will be
    allocated by the function itself. You must call <i>curl_formfree(3)</i> on
    the <i>firstitem</i> after the form post has been done to free the
    resources.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using POST with HTTP 1.1 implies the use of a &quot;Expect:
    100-continue&quot; header. You can disable this header with
    <i>CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER(3)</i> as usual.</p>
<p class="Pp">First, there are some basics you need to understand about
    multipart/formdata posts. Each part consists of at least a NAME and a
    CONTENTS part. If the part is made for file upload, there are also a stored
    CONTENT-TYPE and a FILENAME. Below, we'll discuss what options you use to
    set these properties in the parts you want to add to your post.</p>
<p class="Pp">The options listed first are for making normal parts. The options
    from <i>CURLFORM_FILE</i> through <i>CURLFORM_BUFFERLENGTH</i> are for file
    upload parts.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>CURLFORM_COPYNAME</dt>
  <dd>followed by a string which provides the <i>name</i> of this part. libcurl
      copies the string so your application doesn't need to keep it around after
      this function call. If the name isn't NUL-terminated, you must set its
      length with <b>CURLFORM_NAMELENGTH</b>. The <i>name</i> is not allowed to
      contain zero-valued bytes. The copied data will be freed by
      <i>curl_formfree(3)</i>.</dd>
  <dt>CURLFORM_PTRNAME</dt>
  <dd>followed by a string which provides the <i>name</i> of this part. libcurl
      will use the pointer and refer to the data in your application, so you
      must make sure it remains until curl no longer needs it. If the name isn't
      NUL-terminated, you must set its length with <b>CURLFORM_NAMELENGTH</b>.
      The <i>name</i> is not allowed to contain zero-valued bytes.</dd>
  <dt>CURLFORM_COPYCONTENTS</dt>
  <dd>followed by a pointer to the contents of this part, the actual data to
      send away. libcurl copies the provided data, so your application doesn't
      need to keep it around after this function call. If the data isn't null
      terminated, or if you'd like it to contain zero bytes, you must set the
      length of the name with <b>CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH</b>. The copied data
      will be freed by <i>curl_formfree(3)</i>.</dd>
  <dt>CURLFORM_PTRCONTENTS</dt>
  <dd>followed by a pointer to the contents of this part, the actual data to
      send away. libcurl will use the pointer and refer to the data in your
      application, so you must make sure it remains until curl no longer needs
      it. If the data isn't NUL-terminated, or if you'd like it to contain zero
      bytes, you must set its length with <b>CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH</b>.</dd>
  <dt>CURLFORM_CONTENTLEN</dt>
  <dd>followed by a curl_off_t value giving the length of the contents. Note
      that for <i>CURLFORM_STREAM</i> contents, this option is mandatory.
    <p class="Pp">If you pass a 0 (zero) for this option, libcurl will instead
        do a strlen() on the contents to figure out the size. If you really want
        to send a zero byte content then you must make sure strlen() on the data
        pointer returns zero.</p>
    <p class="Pp">(Option added in 7.46.0)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH</dt>
  <dd>(This option is deprecated. Use <i>CURLFORM_CONTENTLEN</i> instead!)
    <p class="Pp">followed by a long giving the length of the contents. Note
        that for <i>CURLFORM_STREAM</i> contents, this option is mandatory.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you pass a 0 (zero) for this option, libcurl will instead
        do a strlen() on the contents to figure out the size. If you really want
        to send a zero byte content then you must make sure strlen() on the data
        pointer returns zero.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>CURLFORM_FILECONTENT</dt>
  <dd>followed by a filename, causes that file to be read and its contents used
      as data in this part. This part does <i>not</i> automatically become a
      file upload part simply because its data was read from a file.
    <p class="Pp">The specified file needs to kept around until the associated
        transfer is done.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>CURLFORM_FILE</dt>
  <dd>followed by a filename, makes this part a file upload part. It sets the
      <i>filename</i> field to the basename of the provided filename, it reads
      the contents of the file and passes them as data and sets the content-type
      if the given file match one of the internally known file extensions. For
      <b>CURLFORM_FILE</b> the user may send one or more files in one part by
      providing multiple <b>CURLFORM_FILE</b> arguments each followed by the
      filename (and each <i>CURLFORM_FILE</i> is allowed to have a
      <i>CURLFORM_CONTENTTYPE</i>).
    <p class="Pp">The given upload file has to exist in its full in the file
        system already when the upload starts, as libcurl needs to read the
        correct file size beforehand.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The specified file needs to kept around until the associated
        transfer is done.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>CURLFORM_CONTENTTYPE</dt>
  <dd>is used in combination with <i>CURLFORM_FILE</i>. Followed by a pointer to
      a string which provides the content-type for this part, possibly instead
      of an internally chosen one.</dd>
  <dt>CURLFORM_FILENAME</dt>
  <dd>is used in combination with <i>CURLFORM_FILE</i>. Followed by a pointer to
      a string, it tells libcurl to use the given string as the <i>filename</i>
      in the file upload part instead of the actual file name.</dd>
  <dt>CURLFORM_BUFFER</dt>
  <dd>is used for custom file upload parts without use of <i>CURLFORM_FILE</i>.
      It tells libcurl that the file contents are already present in a buffer.
      The parameter is a string which provides the <i>filename</i> field in the
      content header.</dd>
  <dt>CURLFORM_BUFFERPTR</dt>
  <dd>is used in combination with <i>CURLFORM_BUFFER</i>. The parameter is a
      pointer to the buffer to be uploaded. This buffer must not be freed until
      after <i>curl_easy_cleanup(3)</i> is called. You must also use
      <i>CURLFORM_BUFFERLENGTH</i> to set the number of bytes in the
    buffer.</dd>
  <dt>CURLFORM_BUFFERLENGTH</dt>
  <dd>is used in combination with <i>CURLFORM_BUFFER</i>. The parameter is a
      long which gives the length of the buffer.</dd>
  <dt>CURLFORM_STREAM</dt>
  <dd>Tells libcurl to use the <i>CURLOPT_READFUNCTION(3)</i> callback to get
      data. The parameter you pass to <i>CURLFORM_STREAM</i> is the pointer
      passed on to the read callback's fourth argument. If you want the part to
      look like a file upload one, set the <i>CURLFORM_FILENAME</i> parameter as
      well. Note that when using <i>CURLFORM_STREAM</i>,
      <i>CURLFORM_CONTENTSLENGTH</i> must also be set with the total expected
      length of the part unless the formpost is sent chunked encoded. (Option
      added in libcurl 7.18.2)</dd>
  <dt>CURLFORM_ARRAY</dt>
  <dd>Another possibility to send options to curl_formadd() is the
      <b>CURLFORM_ARRAY</b> option, that passes a struct curl_forms array
      pointer as its value. Each curl_forms structure element has a
      CURLformoption and a char pointer. The final element in the array must be
      a CURLFORM_END. All available options can be used in an array, except the
      CURLFORM_ARRAY option itself! The last argument in such an array must
      always be <b>CURLFORM_END</b>.</dd>
  <dt>CURLFORM_CONTENTHEADER</dt>
  <dd>specifies extra headers for the form POST section. This takes a curl_slist
      prepared in the usual way using <b>curl_slist_append</b> and appends the
      list of headers to those libcurl automatically generates. The list must
      exist while the POST occurs, if you free it before the post completes you
      may experience problems.
    <p class="Pp">When you've passed the HttpPost pointer to
        <i>curl_easy_setopt(3)</i> (using the <i>CURLOPT_HTTPPOST(3)</i>
        option), you must not free the list until after you've called
        <i>curl_easy_cleanup(3)</i> for the curl handle.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See example below.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="AVAILABILITY"><a class="permalink" href="#AVAILABILITY">AVAILABILITY</a></h1>
Deprecated in 7.56.0. Before this release, field names were allowed to contain
  zero-valued bytes. The pseudo-filename &quot;-&quot; to read stdin is
  discouraged although still supported, but data is not read before being
  actually sent: the effective data size can then not be automatically
  determined, resulting in a chunked encoding transfer. Backslashes and double
  quotes in field and file names are now escaped before transmission.
