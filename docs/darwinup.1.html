<code class="Nm">darwinup</code> allows you to manage roots, or archives, of
  files that replace parts of your system. This is useful for installing a new
  version of a library or tool on your system while allowing you to uninstall
  the files and revert back to the originals safely and easily.

  <dt>-f</dt>
  <dd>Force. Some operations will fail gracefully due to potentially unsafe
      situations, such as a root that installs a file where a directory is. In
      order to have darwinup continue through such a situation, you can pass the
      -f option.</dd>
  <dt>-n</dt>
  <dd>Dry run. Darwinup will go through an operation, including analyzing the
      root(s) and printing the state/change symbol, but no files will be
      modified on your system and no records will be added to the depot. This
      option implies -d.</dd>
  <dt>-p [<var class="Ar">path</var>]</dt>
  <dd>Prefix path. Normally, darwinup will operate on the boot partition. You
      can use the -p option to have darwinup work on another partition. You can
      provide any arbitrary path, it does not need to be a mount point.</dd>
  <dt>-r</dt>
  <dd>Restart. Gracefully restart after all operations are complete by telling
      Finder to restart.</dd>
  <dt>-v</dt>
  <dd>Verbose. This option causes darwinup to print extra information. You can
      pass 2 or 3 v's for even more information, but that is usually only needed
      for development and debugging of darwinup itself.</dd>

  <dt>?</dt>
  <dd>Unknown state. Probably a bug.</dd>
  <dt>!</dt>
  <dd>Missing file during uninstall. Darwinup expected a file or directory to
      exist, but it did not. This could be a bug in darwinup, but most likely
      another tool or software update removed a file that darwinup had been
      tracking. It can also be caused by an installation failing due to an
      object changing type (see FORCING OPERATIONS below), and the subsequent
      rollback finding the root only partially installed. Since these all happen
      during uninstall, they are typically safe to ignore, since darwinup was
      going to delete the object anyway.</dd>
  <dt>A</dt>
  <dd>Added. No previous file or directory existed so the file or directory was
      added to your system.</dd>
  <dt>E</dt>
  <dd>External change. The file you are installing is different than the last
      file you installed, but it is identical to what was actually found on
      disk. This probably means something manually installed a root or software
      update without darwinup knowing about it. This is usually harmless.</dd>
  <dt>M</dt>
  <dd>Mode change. Only changes to permission or ownership were needed to
      uninstall the file or directory.</dd>
  <dt>R</dt>
  <dd>Removed. No previous file or directory existed, so the uninstall process
      removed the file.</dd>
  <dt>U</dt>
  <dd>Updated. During installation, the file or directory replaces an existing
      object at the same path. During uninstallation, the previous version of
      the file was restored.</dd>
  <dt>I</dt>
  <dd>Ignored. A file specified in the removal list was not removed. This
      usually indicates that the file was a directory and the path in the
      removal list lacked a trailing <span class="Pa">/</span> character.</dd>

  <dd>You can install archive files or directories by specifying a relative or

When running a subcommand which takes an <var class="Ar">archive</var> argument,
  you can use one or more of the following items to specify which archive to
  operate on. You can mix and match any of them as needed. You can use the list
  subcommand with these specifications to see what will match.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><var class="Ar">serial</var></dt>
  <dd>You can specify an archive with its serial number, which can be found
      using the list subcommand.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Ar">uuid</var></dt>
  <dd>You can specify an archive with its UUID, which can be found using the
      list subcommand.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Ar">name</var></dt>
  <dd>You can specify an archive with its name, which can be found using the
      list subcommand.</dd>
  <dt>newest</dt>
  <dd>The newest keyword will match the one archive which was most recently
      installed. This should always be the first archive listed.</dd>
  <dt>oldest</dt>
  <dd>The oldest keyword will match the one archive which was installed the
      longest time ago. This should always be the last archive listed.</dd>
  <dt>superseded</dt>
  <dd>The superseded keyword will match zero or more archives. An archive is
      superseded if every file it contains is contained in an archive that was
      (and still is) installed after it. A file in an archive can also be
      superseded by external changes, such as operating system updates. When
      uninstalling a superseded archive, you should never see any status
      symbols, since being superseded means there is a newer file on disk.</dd>
  <dt>all</dt>
  <dd>The all keyword will match all archives. If you specify extra verbosity
      with -vv, then rollback archives will also be matched by the all keyword.
      This means that <code class="Nm">darwinup -vv uninstall all</code> will
      attempt to uninstall rollback archives, which will print a message about
      not being able to uninstall rollback archives. This is normal and not a
      problem.</dd>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="FORCING_OPERATIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#FORCING_OPERATIONS">FORCING
  OPERATIONS</a></h1>
There are 2 cases where darwinup will require you to pass the force (-f) option
  before proceeding with an operation.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Object Type Change</dt>
  <dd>If you install an archive which contains a file with the same path as a
      directory on your system, or vice versa, darwinup will give you a error
      about not doing that unless you really want to force it. If you do force
      the operation, darwinup will delete the existing object and replace it
      with the object from the root. This can happen when a directory full of
      files gets packaged up in some opaque file, like xibs/nibs. If you expect
      this &quot;type change&quot;, then it is probably safe to force the
      operation.</dd>
  <dt>Uninstall a root from an older base system</dt>
  <dd>Darwinup remembers the version (build) of the operating system when a root
      is installed. The reason for this is darwinup saves the old (replaced)
      files during the installation procedure. Those backups may have come from
      the older operating system, and thus are not necessarily compatible with
      the current build of the operating system. So if you try to uninstall an
      archive that had been installed on a different version of the operating
      system, darwinup will stop and provide a message asking you to force the
      operation if you really want to. If the files you are uninstalling are all
      superseded, then you should not get this error as the backup copies will
      not be used anyway.</dd>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="HELPFUL_AUTOMATION"><a class="permalink" href="#HELPFUL_AUTOMATION">HELPFUL
  AUTOMATION</a></h1>
Darwinup tries to detect common situations and run external tools that you would
  otherwise have to remember to run yourself. The &quot;dry run&quot; (-n) and
  &quot;disable automation&quot; (-d) options prevent any of the following from
  happening.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Dyld Cache</dt>
  <dd>If a root modifies any file, then darwinup will run
      update_dyld_shared_cache unless the -d option is specified.</dd>
  <dt>Kernel Extensions</dt>
  <dd>If a root modifies a file under /System/Library/Extensions, then darwinup
      will update the mtime of /System/Library/Extensions to ensure that the
      kext cache is updated during the next boot.</dd>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="REMOVING_FILES"><a class="permalink" href="#REMOVING_FILES">REMOVING
  FILES</a></h1>
<code class="Nm">darwinup</code> supports removing files from disk as part of
  installing a root. These files must be enumerated in a list that is included
  in the root at the path <span class="Pa">/.DarwinMetadata/removals</span>. The
  list is a simple text file consisting of paths to remove, separated by new
  lines. Directories may be present in this list. If a directory is to be
  removed, its path must include a trailing '/' character, and all of its
  descendants will be removed. When files are removed as part of root
  installation, they will be restored when the root is uninstalled with the
  <var class="Ar">uninstall</var> command.
<p class="Pp">It is permissible for the root to contain files that are specified
    in its removal list. This is primarily useful for replacing entire directory
    hierarchies as singular entities.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i class="Em">IMPORTANT</i>: Replacing a directory hierarchy can
    only be done safely if the root creator has full knowledge of the contents
    of a given directory hierarchy and knows how to completely populate it such
    that all dependencies will be satisfied. For example, a project which
    installs content into <span class="Pa">/usr/include</span> should
    <i class="Em">not</i> specify that path in its removal list since many other
    projects populate that directory. The result of the removal operation in
    such a case would be the only the contents of the root would exist in
    <span class="Pa">/usr/include</span> after the installation completes.
    <code class="Nm">darwinup</code> cannot and does not protect against this
    scenario, so exercise extreme caution when constructing roots with removal
    lists.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i class="Em">NOTE</i>: Neither the
    <span class="Pa">.DarwinMetadata</span> directory nor its contents will be
    installed into the destination path.</p>
