Using this function, you can explicitly mark a running connection to get paused,
  and you can unpause a connection that was previously paused.
<p class="Pp">A connection can be paused by using this function or by letting
    the read or the write callbacks return the proper magic return code
    (<i>CURL_READFUNC_PAUSE</i> and <i>CURL_WRITEFUNC_PAUSE</i>). A write
    callback that returns pause signals to the library that it couldn't take
    care of any data at all, and that data will then be delivered again to the
    callback when the writing is later unpaused.</p>
<p class="Pp">While it may feel tempting, take care and notice that you cannot
    call this function from another thread. To unpause, you may for example call
    it from the progress callback (<i>CURLOPT_PROGRESSFUNCTION(3)</i>), which
    gets called at least once per second, even if the connection is paused.</p>
<p class="Pp">When this function is called to unpause reading, the chance is
    high that you will get your write callback called before this function
    returns.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>handle</b> argument is of course identifying the handle
    that operates on the connection you want to pause or unpause.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>bitmask</b> argument is a set of bits that sets the new
    state of the connection. The following bits can be used:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>CURLPAUSE_RECV</dt>
  <dd>Pause receiving data. There will be no data received on this connection
      until this function is called again without this bit set. Thus, the write
      callback (<i>CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION(3)</i>) won't be called.</dd>
  <dt>CURLPAUSE_SEND</dt>
  <dd>Pause sending data. There will be no data sent on this connection until
      this function is called again without this bit set. Thus, the read
      callback (<i>CURLOPT_READFUNCTION(3)</i>) won't be called.</dd>
  <dt>CURLPAUSE_ALL</dt>
  <dd>Convenience define that pauses both directions.</dd>
  <dt>CURLPAUSE_CONT</dt>
  <dd>Convenience define that unpauses both directions.</dd>
</dl>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RETURN_VALUE"><a class="permalink" href="#RETURN_VALUE">RETURN
  VALUE</a></h1>
CURLE_OK (zero) means that the option was set properly, and a non-zero return
  code means something wrong occurred after the new state was set. See the
  <i>libcurl-errors(3)</i> man page for the full list with descriptions.

The pausing of transfers does not work with protocols that work without network
  connectivity, like FILE://. Trying to pause such a transfer, in any direction,
  will cause problems in the worst case or an error in the best case.

This function was added in libcurl 7.18.0. Before this version, there was no
  explicit support for pausing transfers.

<h1 class="Sh" id="USAGE_WITH_THE_MULTI-SOCKET_INTERFACE"><a class="permalink" href="#USAGE_WITH_THE_MULTI-SOCKET_INTERFACE">USAGE
  WITH THE MULTI-SOCKET INTERFACE</a></h1>
Before libcurl 7.32.0, when a specific handle was unpaused with this function,
  there was no particular forced rechecking or similar of the socket's state,
  which made the continuation of the transfer get delayed until next
  multi-socket call invoke or even longer. Alternatively, the user could
  forcibly call for example <i>curl_multi_socket_all(3)</i> - with a rather
  hefty performance penalty.
<p class="Pp">Starting in libcurl 7.32.0, unpausing a transfer will schedule a
    timeout trigger for that handle 1 millisecond into the future, so that a
    curl_multi_socket_action( ... CURL_SOCKET_TIMEOUT) can be used immediately
    afterwards to get the transfer going again as desired.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="MEMORY_USE"><a class="permalink" href="#MEMORY_USE">MEMORY
  USE</a></h1>
When pausing a read by returning the magic return code from a write callback,
  the read data is already in libcurl's internal buffers so it'll have to keep
  it in an allocated buffer until the reading is again unpaused using this
  function.
<p class="Pp">If the downloaded data is compressed and is asked to get
    uncompressed automatically on download, libcurl will continue to uncompress
    the entire downloaded chunk and it will cache the data uncompressed. This
    has the side- effect that if you download something that is compressed a
    lot, it can result in a very large data amount needing to be allocated to
    save the data during the pause. This said, you should probably consider not
    using paused reading if you allow libcurl to uncompress data
  automatically.</p>
