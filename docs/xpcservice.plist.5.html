This document describes the keys-value pairs which configure an XPC Service. An
  XPC Service is a process which implements the server-side of an
  <code class="Nm">XPC</code> connection. The service program is contained
  inside a Mac OS X bundle. The bundle contains an Info.plist. The XPC Service
  configuration settings are specified by keys and values defined in a
  dictionary included within the Info.plist.

An application has a namespace which maps a service name to a running instance
  of the service program. The namespace is created dynamically and is unique to
  each application. The namespace is populated with the set of services embedded
  in the application bundle and embedded in the frameworks used by the
  application.
<p class="Pp">System frameworks may have embedded XPC Services. Typically, a
    developer would not connect to this service directly. Instead, the developer
    would call an API function in the framework and that would contact the
    service. However, the name of XPC Service must be in the application's
    namespace so that the framework code can &quot;see&quot; and connect to the
    service.</p>
<p class="Pp">XPC Services are &quot;launched-on-demand&quot;. They are only
    started when an application creates a connection to the service and sends a
    message to it. The service process can be terminated when it is inactive and
    has been idle for a a period of time. The service process can be started
    again upon receipt of a new message or connection request. XPC Services
    should be state-less so that they can come and go as needed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The results of a connection request to an XPC Service from two
    different applications depends upon the type of the service. The service
    type controls the policy used to create a new instance of the service. For
    example, a new connection request from two different applications to an
    Application-type service in a framework will result in a new instance of the
    service being created for each application. However, if two applications
    request the same User-type service, then only one instance of the service
    will be created for each user.</p>
<p class="Pp">Services embedded in an application bundle will only be visible to
    the containing application and will be, by default, Application-type
    services. A subsequent connection request from an application to a service
    will result in a new connection to an existing service.</p>

  Bundle Keys</a></h1>
These top-level Info.plist keys are required to be defined in the Info.plist
  file:
<dl class="Bl-ohang">
  <dt><b class="Sy">CFBundleIdentifier &lt;string&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>This key defines the name of the service; clients use this name to connect
      to the service.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">CFBundlePackageType &quot;XPC!&quot;</b></dt>
  <dd>This key identifies the bundle as being an XPC Service.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">XPCService &lt;dictionary&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>This key defines a dictionary which contains the settings to configure the
      XPC Service.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="XPCService_Dictionary_Keys"><a class="permalink" href="#XPCService_Dictionary_Keys">XPCService
  Dictionary Keys</a></h1>
The XPC Service may be configured by setting these keys in the <i>XPCService</i>
  dictionary:
<dl class="Bl-ohang">
  <dt><b class="Sy">ServiceType &lt;string&gt; (default: Application</b>)</dt>
  <dd>The type of the XPC Service specifies how the service is instantiated. The
      values are:
    <ul class="Bl-bullet">
      <li>Application
        <br/>
        Each application will have a unique instance of this service.</li>
      <li>User
        <br/>
        There is one instance of the service process created for each user.</li>
      <li>System
        <br/>
        There is one instance of the service process for the whole system.
          System XPC Services are restricted to reside in system frameworks and
          must be owned by root.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">RunLoopType &lt;string&gt; (default: dispatch_main)</b></dt>
  <dd>The RunLoop type specifies which style of runloop will be started once
      xpc_main has finished initializing. The values are:
    <ul class="Bl-bullet">
      <li>dispatch_main
        <br/>
        xpc_main will call dispatch_main().</li>
      <li>NSRunLoop
        <br/>
        xpc_main will call [[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] run].</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">JoinExistingSession &lt;bool&gt; (default: False)</b></dt>
  <dd>By default XPC Services are placed into their own unique audit session. If
      this key is true, then the service is placed into the session of the
      application requesting a connection to the service.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy">EnvironmentVariables &lt;dictionary&gt; (default:
    none)</b></dt>
  <dd>A dictionary containing environment variables (represented as key-value
      pairs) which are set in the environment of the service process.</dd>
