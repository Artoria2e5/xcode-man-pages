snmp_config - handling of Net-SNMP configuration files
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The Net-SNMP package uses various configuration files to configure its
  applications. This manual page merely describes the overall nature of them, so
  that the other manual pages don't have to.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DIRECTORIES_SEARCHED"><a class="permalink" href="#DIRECTORIES_SEARCHED">DIRECTORIES
  SEARCHED</a></h1>
First off, there are numerous places that configuration files can be found and
  read from. By default, the applications look for configuration files in the
  following 4 directories, in order: /etc/snmp, /usr/share/snmp, /usr/lib/snmp,
  and $HOME/.snmp. In each of these directories, it looks for files with the
  extension of both <i>conf</i> and <i>local.conf</i> (reading the second ones
  last). In this manner, there are 8 default places a configuration file can
  exist for any given configuration file type.
<p class="Pp">Additionally, the above default search path can be overridden by
    setting the environment variable SNMPCONFPATH to a colon-separated list of
    directories to search for. The path for the persistent data should be
    included when running applications that use persistent storage, such as
    snmpd.</p>
<p class="Pp">Applications will read persistent configuration files in the
    following order of preference:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">file in <b>SNMP_PERSISTENT_FILE</b> environment variable</p>
<p class="Pp">directories in <b>SNMPCONFPATH</b> environment variable</p>
<p class="Pp">directory defined by <b>persistentDir</b> snmp.conf variable</p>
<p class="Pp">directory in <b>SNMP_PERSISTENT_DIR</b> environment variable</p>
<p class="Pp">default <b>/var/db/net-snmp</b> directory</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Finally, applications will write persistent configuration files in
    the following order of preference:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">file in <b>SNMP_PERSISTENT_FILE</b> environment variable</p>
<p class="Pp">directory defined by <b>persistentDir</b> snmp.conf variable</p>
<p class="Pp">directory in <b>SNMP_PERSISTENT_DIR</b> environment variable</p>
<p class="Pp">default <b>/var/db/net-snmp</b> directory</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note: When using SNMP_PERSISTENT_FILE, the filename should match
    the application name. For example, /var/net-snmp/snmpd.conf.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_FILE_TYPES"><a class="permalink" href="#CONFIGURATION_FILE_TYPES">CONFIGURATION
  FILE TYPES</a></h1>
Each application may use multiple configuration files, which will configure
  various different aspects of the application. For instance, the SNMP agent
  (<b>snmpd</b>) knows how to understand configuration directives in both the
  snmpd.conf and the snmp.conf files. In fact, most applications understand how
  to read the contents of the snmp.conf files. Note, however, that configuration
  directives understood in one file may not be understood in another file. For
  further information, read the associated manual page with each configuration
  file type. Also, most of the applications support a <b>-H</b> switch on the
  command line that will list the configuration files it will look for and the
  directives in each one that it understands.
<p class="Pp">The snmp.conf configuration file is intended to be a application
    suite wide configuration file that supports directives that are useful for
    controlling the fundamental nature of all of the SNMP applications, such as
    how they all manipulate and parse the textual SNMP MIB files.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SWITCHING_CONFIGURATION_TYPES_IN_MID-FILE"><a class="permalink" href="#SWITCHING_CONFIGURATION_TYPES_IN_MID-FILE">SWITCHING
  CONFIGURATION TYPES IN MID-FILE</a></h1>
It's possible to switch in mid-file the configuration type that the parser is
  supposed to be reading. Since that sentence doesn't make much sense, lets give
  you an example: say that you wanted to turn on packet dumping output for the
  agent by default, but you didn't want to do that for the rest of the
  applications (ie, snmpget, snmpwalk, ...). Normally to enable packet dumping
  in the configuration file you'd need to put a line like:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">dumpPacket true</div>
<p class="Pp">into the snmp.conf file. But, this would turn it on for all of the
    applications. So, instead, you can put the same line in the snmpd.conf file
    so that it only applies to the snmpd daemon. However, you need to tell the
    parser to expect this line. You do this by putting a special type
    specification token inside a [] set. In other words, inside your snmpd.conf
    file you could put the above snmp.conf directive by adding a line like
  so:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">[snmp] dumpPacket true</div>
<p class="Pp">This tells the parser to parse the above line as if it were inside
    a snmp.conf file instead of an snmpd.conf file. If you want to parse a bunch
    of lines rather than just one then you can make the context switch apply to
    the remainder of the file or until the next context switch directive by
    putting the special token on a line by itself:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
# make this file handle snmp.conf tokens:
[snmp]
dumpPacket true
logTimestamp true
# return to our original snmpd.conf tokens:
[snmpd]
rocommunity mypublic
</pre>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMENTS">COMMENTS</a></h1>
Any lines beginning with the character '#' in the configuration files are
  treated as a comment and are not parsed.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="INCLUDING_OTHER_CONFIGURATION_FILES"><a class="permalink" href="#INCLUDING_OTHER_CONFIGURATION_FILES">INCLUDING
  OTHER CONFIGURATION FILES</a></h1>
It is possible to include other configuration files for processing during normal
  configuration file processing.:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
# include site specific config
include site.conf
</pre>
</div>
<pre>
This will search every directory in the configuration path for files
named site.conf, and will process those files before returning to the
processing of the original file. Note that if '.conf' is omitted,
it will be appended. That is, all configuration files must end
in '.conf'.
</pre>

Information about writing C code that makes use of this system in either the
  agent's MIB modules or in applications can be found in the
  <i>netsnmp_config_api(3)</i> manual page.
