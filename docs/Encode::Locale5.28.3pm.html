   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it
  processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still byte
  based. Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the program
  from the outside and encode them again on the way out.
<p class="Pp">The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language
    conventions requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume
    and output. The <span class="Li">&quot;Encode::Locale&quot;</span> module
    looks up the charset and encoding (called a CODESET in the locale jargon)
    and arranges for the Encode module to know this encoding under the name
    &quot;locale&quot;. It means bytes obtained from the environment can be
    converted to Unicode strings by calling
    <span class="Li">&quot;Encode::encode(locale =&gt; $bytes)&quot;</span> and
    converted back again with <span class="Li">&quot;Encode::decode(locale =&gt;
    $string)&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Where file systems interfaces pass file names in and out of the
    program we also need care. The trend is for operating systems to use a fixed
    file encoding that don't actually depend on the locale; and this module
    determines the most appropriate encoding for file names. The Encode module
    will know this encoding under the name &quot;locale_fs&quot;. For
    traditional Unix systems this will be an alias to the same encoding as
    &quot;locale&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">For programs running in a terminal window (called a
    &quot;Console&quot; on some systems) the &quot;locale&quot; encoding is
    usually a good choice for what to expect as input and output. Some systems
    allows us to query the encoding set for the terminal and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Encode::Locale&quot;</span> will do that if available
    and make these encodings known under the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Encode&quot;</span> aliases &quot;console_in&quot;
    and &quot;console_out&quot;. For systems where we can't determine the
    terminal encoding these will be aliased as the same encoding as
    &quot;locale&quot;. The advice is to use &quot;console_in&quot; for input
    known to come from the terminal and &quot;console_out&quot; for output to
    the terminal.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition to arranging for various Encode aliases the following
    functions and variables are provided:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>decode_argv( )</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>decode_argv( Encode::FB_CROAK )</dt>
  <dd>This will decode the command line arguments to perl (the
      <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> array) in-place.
    <p class="Pp">The function will by default replace characters that can't be
        decoded by &quot;\x{FFFD}&quot;, the Unicode replacement character.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Any argument provided is passed as CHECK to underlying
        <b>Encode::decode()</b> call. Pass the value
        <span class="Li">&quot;Encode::FB_CROAK&quot;</span> to have the
        decoding croak if not all the command line arguments can be decoded. See
        &quot;Handling Malformed Data&quot; in Encode for details on other
        options for CHECK.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>env( $uni_key )</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>env( $uni_key =&gt; $uni_value )</dt>
  <dd>Interface to get/set environment variables. Returns the current value as a
      Unicode string. The <span class="Li">$uni_key</span> and
      <span class="Li">$uni_value</span> arguments are expected to be Unicode
      strings as well. Passing <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> as
      <span class="Li">$uni_value</span> deletes the environment variable named
      <span class="Li">$uni_key</span>.
    <p class="Pp">The returned value will have the characters that can't be
        decoded replaced by &quot;\x{FFFD}&quot;, the Unicode replacement
        character.</p>
    <p class="Pp">There is no interface to request alternative CHECK behavior as
        for <b>decode_argv()</b>. If you need that you need to call
        encode/decode yourself. For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    my $key = Encode::encode(locale =&gt; $uni_key, Encode::FB_CROAK);
    my $uni_value = Encode::decode(locale =&gt; $ENV{$key}, Encode::FB_CROAK);
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>reinit( )</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>reinit( $encoding )</dt>
  <dd>Reinitialize the encodings from the locale. You want to call this function
      if you changed anything in the environment that might influence the
      locale.
    <p class="Pp">This function will croak if the determined encoding isn't
        recognized by the Encode module.</p>
    <p class="Pp">With argument force <span class="Li">$ENCODING_</span>...
        variables to set to the given value.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>$ENCODING_LOCALE</dt>
  <dd>The encoding name determined to be suitable for the current locale. Encode
      know this encoding as &quot;locale&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>$ENCODING_LOCALE_FS</dt>
  <dd>The encoding name determined to be suitable for file system interfaces
      involving file names. Encode know this encoding as
    &quot;locale_fs&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>$ENCODING_CONSOLE_IN</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>$ENCODING_CONSOLE_OUT</dt>
  <dd>The encodings to be used for reading and writing output to the a console.
      Encode know these encodings as &quot;console_in&quot; and
      &quot;console_out&quot;.</dd>

Windows has basically 2 sets of APIs. A wide API (based on passing UTF-16
  strings) and a byte based API based a character set called ANSI. The regular
  Perl interfaces to the OS currently only uses the ANSI APIs. Unfortunately
  ANSI is not a single character set.
<p class="Pp">The encoding that corresponds to ANSI varies between different
    editions of Windows. For many western editions of Windows ANSI corresponds
    to CP-1252 which is a character set similar to ISO-8859-1. Conceptually the
    ANSI character set is a similar concept to the POSIX locale CODESET so this
    module figures out what the ANSI code page is and make this available as
    <span class="Li">$ENCODING_LOCALE</span> and the &quot;locale&quot; Encoding
    alias.</p>
<p class="Pp">Windows systems also operate with another byte based character
    set. It's called the OEM code page. This is the encoding that the Console
    takes as input and output. It's common for the OEM code page to differ from
    the ANSI code page.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Mac__s-1OS_X_s0"><a class="permalink" href="#Mac__s-1OS_X_s0">Mac
  OS X</a></h2>
On Mac OS X the file system encoding is always UTF-8 while the locale can
  otherwise be set up as normal for POSIX systems.
<p class="Pp">File names on Mac OS X will at the OS-level be converted to
    NFD-form. A file created by passing a NFC-filename will come in NFD-form
    from <b>readdir()</b>. See Unicode::Normalize for details of NFD/NFC.</p>
<p class="Pp">Actually, Apple does not follow the Unicode NFD standard since not
    all character ranges are decomposed. The claim is that this avoids problems
    with round trip conversions from old Mac text encodings. See Encode::UTF8Mac
    for details.</p>

File systems might vary in what encoding is to be used for filenames. Since this
  module has no way to actually figure out what the is correct it goes with the
  best guess which is to assume filenames are encoding according to the current
  locale. Users are advised to always specify UTF-8 as the locale charset.
