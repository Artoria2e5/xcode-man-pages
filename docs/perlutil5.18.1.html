   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

perlutil - utilities packaged with the Perl distribution
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Along with the Perl interpreter itself, the Perl distribution installs a range
  of utilities on your system. There are also several utilities which are used
  by the Perl distribution itself as part of the install process. This document
  exists to list all of these utilities, explain what they are for and provide
  pointers to each module's documentation, if appropriate.

<h2 class="Ss" id="Documentation"><a class="permalink" href="#Documentation">Documentation</a></h2>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>perldoc</dt>
  <dd>The main interface to Perl's documentation is
      <span class="Li">&quot;perldoc&quot;</span>, although if you're reading
      this, it's more than likely that you've already found it. <i>perldoc</i>
      will extract and format the documentation from any file in the current
      directory, any Perl module installed on the system, or any of the standard
      documentation pages, such as this one. Use <span class="Li">&quot;perldoc
      &lt;name&gt;&quot;</span> to get information on any of the utilities
      described in this document.</dd>
  <dt>pod2man and pod2text</dt>
  <dd>If it's run from a terminal, <i>perldoc</i> will usually call
      <i>pod2man</i> to translate POD (Plain Old Documentation - see perlpod for
      an explanation) into a manpage, and then run <i>man</i> to display it; if
      <i>man</i> isn't available, <i>pod2text</i> will be used instead and the
      output piped through your favourite pager.</dd>
  <dt>pod2html and pod2latex</dt>
  <dd>As well as these two, there are two other converters: <i>pod2html</i> will
      produce HTML pages from POD, and <i>pod2latex</i>, which produces LaTeX
      files.</dd>
  <dt>pod2usage</dt>
  <dd>If you just want to know how to use the utilities described here,
      <i>pod2usage</i> will just extract the &quot;USAGE&quot; section; some of
      the utilities will automatically call <i>pod2usage</i> on themselves when
      you call them with <span class="Li">&quot;-help&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>podselect</dt>
  <dd><i>pod2usage</i> is a special case of <i>podselect</i>, a utility to
      extract named sections from documents written in POD. For instance, while
      utilities have &quot;USAGE&quot; sections, Perl modules usually have
      &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot; sections: <span class="Li">&quot;podselect -s
      &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot; ...&quot;</span> will extract this section for a
      given file.</dd>
  <dt>podchecker</dt>
  <dd>If you're writing your own documentation in POD, the <i>podchecker</i>
      utility will look for errors in your markup.</dd>
  <dt>splain</dt>
  <dd><i>splain</i> is an interface to perldiag - paste in your error message to
      it, and it'll explain it for you.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;roffitall&quot;</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;roffitall&quot;</span> utility is not installed
      on your system but lives in the <i>pod/</i> directory of your Perl source
      kit; it converts all the documentation from the distribution to
      <i>*roff</i> format, and produces a typeset PostScript or text file of the
      whole lot.</dd>

To help you convert legacy programs to Perl, we've included three conversion
  filters:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>a2p</dt>
  <dd><i>a2p</i> converts <i>awk</i> scripts to Perl programs; for example,
      <span class="Li">&quot;a2p -F:&quot;</span> on the simple <i>awk</i>
      script <span class="Li">&quot;{print $2}&quot;</span> will produce a Perl
      program based around this code:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        ($Fld1,$Fld2) = split(/[:\n]/, $_, -1);
        print $Fld2;
    }
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>s2p and psed</dt>
  <dd>Similarly, <i>s2p</i> converts <i>sed</i> scripts to Perl programs.
      <i>s2p</i> run on <span class="Li">&quot;s/foo/bar&quot;</span> will
      produce a Perl program based around this:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        chomp;
        s/foo/bar/g;
        print if $printit;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">When invoked as <i>psed</i>, it behaves as a <i>sed</i>
        implementation, written in Perl.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>find2perl</dt>
  <dd>Finally, <i>find2perl</i> translates
      <span class="Li">&quot;find&quot;</span> commands to Perl equivalents
      which use the File::Find module. As an example,
      <span class="Li">&quot;find2perl . -user root -perm 4000
      -print&quot;</span> produces the following callback subroutine for
      <span class="Li">&quot;File::Find&quot;</span>:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    sub wanted {
        my ($dev,$ino,$mode,$nlink,$uid,$gid);
        (($dev,$ino,$mode,$nlink,$uid,$gid) = lstat($_)) &amp;&amp;
        $uid == $uid{'root'}) &amp;&amp;
        (($mode &amp; 0777) == 04000);
        print(&quot;$name\n&quot;);
    }
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">As well as these filters for converting other languages, the pl2pm
    utility will help you convert old-style Perl 4 libraries to new-style Perl5
    modules.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Administration"><a class="permalink" href="#Administration">Administration</a></h2>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>config_data</dt>
  <dd>Query or change configuration of Perl modules that use Module::Build-based
      configuration files for features and config data.</dd>
  <dt>libnetcfg</dt>
  <dd>To display and change the libnet configuration run the libnetcfg
    command.</dd>
  <dt>perlivp</dt>
  <dd>The <i>perlivp</i> program is set up at Perl source code build time to
      test the Perl version it was built under. It can be used after running
      <span class="Li">&quot;make</span> <span class="Li">install&quot;</span>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Development"><a class="permalink" href="#Development">Development</a></h2>
There are a set of utilities which help you in developing Perl programs, and in
  particular, extending Perl with C.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>perlbug</dt>
  <dd><i>perlbug</i> is the recommended way to report bugs in the perl
      interpreter itself or any of the standard library modules back to the
      developers; please read through the documentation for <i>perlbug</i>
      thoroughly before using it to submit a bug report.</dd>
  <dt>perlthanks</dt>
  <dd>This program provides an easy way to send a thank-you message back to the
      authors and maintainers of perl. It's just <i>perlbug</i> installed under
      another name.</dd>
  <dt>h2ph</dt>
  <dd>Back before Perl had the XS system for connecting with C libraries,
      programmers used to get library constants by reading through the C header
      files. You may still see <span class="Li">&quot;require
      'syscall.ph'&quot;</span> or similar around - the <i>.ph</i> file should
      be created by running <i>h2ph</i> on the corresponding <i>.h</i> file. See
      the <i>h2ph</i> documentation for more on how to convert a whole bunch of
      header files at once.</dd>
  <dt>c2ph and pstruct</dt>
  <dd><i>c2ph</i> and <i>pstruct</i>, which are actually the same program but
      behave differently depending on how they are called, provide another way
      of getting at C with Perl - they'll convert C structures and union
      declarations to Perl code. This is deprecated in favour of <i>h2xs</i>
      these days.</dd>
  <dt>h2xs</dt>
  <dd><i>h2xs</i> converts C header files into XS modules, and will try and
      write as much glue between C libraries and Perl modules as it can. It's
      also very useful for creating skeletons of pure Perl modules.</dd>
  <dt>enc2xs</dt>
  <dd><i>enc2xs</i> builds a Perl extension for use by Encode from either
      Unicode Character Mapping files (.ucm) or Tcl Encoding Files (.enc).
      Besides being used internally during the build process of the Encode
      module, you can use <i>enc2xs</i> to add your own encoding to perl. No
      knowledge of XS is necessary.</dd>
  <dt>xsubpp</dt>
  <dd><i>xsubpp</i> is a compiler to convert Perl XS code into C code. It is
      typically run by the makefiles created by ExtUtils::MakeMaker.
    <p class="Pp"><i>xsubpp</i> will compile XS code into C code by embedding
        the constructs necessary to let C functions manipulate Perl values and
        creates the glue necessary to let Perl access those functions.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>prove</dt>
  <dd><i>prove</i> is a command-line interface to the test-running functionality
      of <i>Test::Harness</i>. It's an alternative to
      <span class="Li">&quot;make test&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>corelist</dt>
  <dd>A command-line front-end to
      <span class="Li">&quot;Module::CoreList&quot;</span>, to query what
      modules were shipped with given versions of perl.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="General_tools"><a class="permalink" href="#General_tools">General
  tools</a></h2>
A few general-purpose tools are shipped with perl, mostly because they came
  along modules included in the perl distribution.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>piconv</dt>
  <dd><b>piconv</b> is a Perl version of <b>iconv</b>, a character encoding
      converter widely available for various Unixen today. This script was
      primarily a technology demonstrator for Perl v5.8.0, but you can use
      piconv in the place of iconv for virtually any case.</dd>
  <dt>ptar</dt>
  <dd><i>ptar</i> is a tar-like program, written in pure Perl.</dd>
  <dt>ptardiff</dt>
  <dd><i>ptardiff</i> is a small utility that produces a diff between an
      extracted archive and an unextracted one. (Note that this utility requires
      the <span class="Li">&quot;Text::Diff&quot;</span> module to function
      properly; this module isn't distributed with perl, but is available from
      the CPAN.)</dd>
  <dt>ptargrep</dt>
  <dd><i>ptargrep</i> is a utility to apply pattern matching to the contents of
      files in a tar archive.</dd>
  <dt>shasum</dt>
  <dd>This utility, that comes with the
      <span class="Li">&quot;Digest::SHA&quot;</span> module, is used to print
      or verify SHA checksums.</dd>
  <dt>zipdetails</dt>
  <dd>zipdetails displays information about the internal record structure of the
      zip file. It is not concerned with displaying any details of the
      compressed data stored in the zip file.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Installation"><a class="permalink" href="#Installation">Installation</a></h2>
These utilities help manage extra Perl modules that don't come with the perl
  distribution.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>cpan</dt>
  <dd><i>cpan</i> is a command-line interface to CPAN.pm. It allows you to
      install modules or distributions from CPAN, or just get information about
      them, and a lot more. It is similar to the command line mode of the CPAN
      module,
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    perl -MCPAN -e shell
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>cpanp</dt>
  <dd><i>cpanp</i> is, like <i>cpan</i>, a command-line interface to the CPAN,
      using the <span class="Li">&quot;CPANPLUS&quot;</span> module as a
      back-end. It can be used interactively or imperatively.</dd>
  <dt>cpan2dist</dt>
  <dd><i>cpan2dist</i> is a tool to create distributions (or packages) from CPAN
      modules, then suitable for your package manager of choice. Support for
      specific formats are available from CPAN as
      <span class="Li">&quot;CPANPLUS::Dist::*&quot;</span> modules.</dd>
  <dt>instmodsh</dt>
  <dd>A little interface to ExtUtils::Installed to examine installed modules,
      validate your packlists and even create a tarball from an installed
      module.</dd>
