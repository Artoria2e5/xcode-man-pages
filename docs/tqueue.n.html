   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   RCS: @(#) $Id: man.macros,v 1.1 2009/01/30 04:56:47 andreas_kupries Exp $
  
  	# Set up traps and other miscellaneous stuff for Tcl/Tk man pages.
  	# Start an argument description
  .b
  	# define tabbing values for .AP
  
  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location
  	# ^b = 1
  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)
  	Draw four-sided box normally, but don't draw top of
  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar
  	# Special macro to handle page bottom:  finish off current
  	# box/sidebar if in box/sidebar mode, then invoked standard
  	# page bottom macro.
  	Draw three-sided box if this is the box's first page,
  	draw two sides but no top otherwise.
  	# DS - begin display
  	# DE - end display
  	# SO - start of list of standard options
  	# SE - end of list of standard options
  	# OP - start of full description for a single option
  	# CS - begin code excerpt
  	# CE - end code excerpt

This package provides objects which serialize transfer requests for a single
  channel by means of a fifo queue. Accumulated requests are executed in order
  of entrance, with the first request reaching an idle object starting the
  execution in general. New requests can be added while the object is active and
  are defered until all requests entered before them have been completed
  successfully.
<p class="Pp">When a request causes a transfer error execution stops and all
    requests coming after it are not served. Currently this means that their
    completion callbacks are never triggered at all.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>NOTE</i>: Not triggering the completion callbacks of the
    unserved requests after an error stops the queue object is something I am
    not fully sure that it makes sense. It forces the user of the queue to
    remember the callbacks as well and run them. Because otherwise everything in
    the system which depends on getting a notification about the status of a
    request will hang in the air. I am slowly convincing myself that it is more
    sensible to trigger the relevant completion callbacks with an error message
    about the queue abort, and 0 bytes transfered.</p>
<p class="Pp">All transfer requests are of the form</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
	{type data options...}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">where <i>type</i> is in {<b>chan</b>, <b>string</b>}, and
    <i>data</i> specifies the information to transfer. For <b>chan</b> the data
    is the handle of the channel containing the actual information to transfer,
    whereas for <b>string</b> <i>data</i> contains directly the information to
    transfer. The <i>options</i> are a list of them and their values, and are
    the same as are accepted by the low-level copy operations of the package
    <b>transfer::copy</b>. Note how just prepending the request with
    <b>transfer::copy::do</b> and inserting a channel handle in between
    <i>data</i> and <i>options</i> easily transforms it from a pure data
    structure into a command whose evaluation will perform the request.</p>

  COMMANDS</a></h2>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>transfer::copy::queue</b> <i>objectName</i> <i>outchannel</i>
    ?<i>options</i>...?</dt>
  <dd>This command creates a new queue object for the management of the channel
      <i>outchannel</i>, with an associated Tcl command whose name is
      <i>objectName</i>. This <i>object</i> command is explained in full detail
      in the sections <b>Object command</b> and <b>Object methods</b>. The set
      of supported <i>options</i> is explained in section <b>Options</b>.
    <p class="Pp">The object command will be created under the current namespace
        if the <i>objectName</i> is not fully qualified, and in the specified
        namespace otherwise. The fully qualified name of the object command is
        returned as the result of the command.</p>

  COMMAND</a></h2>
All objects created by the <b>::transfer::copy::queue</b> command have the
  following general form:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>objectName</i> <b>method</b> ?<i>arg arg ...</i>?</dt>
  <dd>The method <b>method</b> and its <i>arg</i>'uments determine the exact
      behavior of the command. See section <b>Object methods</b> for the
      detailed specifications.</dd>

<h2 class="Ss" id="OBJECT_METHODS"><a class="permalink" href="#OBJECT_METHODS">OBJECT
  METHODS</a></h2>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>objectName</i> <b>destroy</b></dt>
  <dd>This method destroys the object. Doing so while the object is busy will
      cause errors later on, when the currently executed request completes and
      tries to access the now missing data structures of the destroyed
    object.</dd>
  <dt><i>objectName</i> <b>busy</b></dt>
  <dd>This method returns a boolean value telling us if the object is currently
      serving a request (i.e. <i>busy</i>, value <b>True</b>), or not (i.e.
      <i>idle</i>, value <b>False</b>).</dd>
  <dt><i>objectName</i> <b>pending</b></dt>
  <dd>This method returns the number of requests currently waiting in the queue
      for their execution. A request currently served is not counted as
    waiting.</dd>
  <dt><i>objectName</i> <b>put</b> <i>request</i></dt>
  <dd>This method enters the transfer <i>request</i> into the object's queue of
      waiting requests. If the object is <i>idle</i> it will become <i>busy</i>,
      immediately servicing the request. Otherwise servicing the new request
      will be defered until all preceding requests have been served.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The only option known is <b>-on-status-change</b>. It is optional and defaults
  to the empty list, disabling the reporting of status changes. Otherwise its
  argument is a command prefix which is invoked whenever the internal status of
  the object changed. The callback is invoked with two additional arguments, the
  result of the methods <b>pending</b> and <b>busy</b>, in this order. This
  allows any user to easily know, for example, when the object has processed all
  outstanding requests.

<h1 class="Sh" id="USE"><a class="permalink" href="#USE">USE</a></h1>
A possible application of this package and class is within a HTTP 1.1 server,
  managing the results waiting for transfer to the client.
<p class="Pp">It should be noted that in this application the system also needs
    an additional data structure which keeps track of outstanding results as
    they may come back in a different order than the requests from the client,
    and releases them to the actual queue in the proper order.</p>
