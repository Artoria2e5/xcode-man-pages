Locale::Codes::Types - types of data sets supported
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document contains a description of different types of code sets supported
  by the <b>Locale-Codes</b> distribution.
<p class="Pp">The following types are supported:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;country&quot;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>&quot;language&quot;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>&quot;currency&quot;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>&quot;script&quot;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>&quot;langfam&quot;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>&quot;langvar&quot;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>&quot;langext&quot;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Any time you have to specify the type of data, use one of the
    values from this list. When using the OO interface, you have to specify the
    type of data you are working with. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   use Locale::Codes;
   ...
   $obj-&gt;type('country');
   $obj-&gt;type('langext');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">When using the traditional interfaces, the functions all have the
    data type included in the function name. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   use Locale::Codes::Country;
   code2country(...);

   use Locale::Codes::LangExt;
   code2langext(...);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Each type of data may have any number of code sets. Code sets may
    be specified by name. Traditionally, a perl constant was exported and could
    also be used to specify the code set.</p>
<p class="Pp">Both methods are available for both the OO and traditional
    interfaces, so whenever a function or method takes an argument specifying a
    code set, either the name or a constant can be used.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the lists below, a code set is specified in the list by
    including the name and the constant. So, for example, the first country code
    set is named <span class="Li">'alpha-2'</span> and has a perl constant
    <span class="Li">&quot;LOCALE_COUNTRY_ALPHA_2&quot;</span> associated with
    it. When using the OO interface, the constants are only available if you
    import them by loading the module with:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
   use Locale::Codes ':constants';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The constants are always available when using the traditional
    interfaces.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some of the older perl constants names were not consistent, and in
    those cases, two constants are available (a newer consistent name and the
    older inconsistent one). Either may be used.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default code set for each type is marked with an asterisk
  (*).</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="country"><a class="permalink" href="#country">country</a></h1>
Code sets for identifying countries are maintained by several different agencies
  and standards.
<p class="Pp">The following code sets are maintained in the ISO 3166 standard.
    The official home page for the ISO 3166 maintenance agency is:
    &lt;http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/country_codes.htm&gt; .</p>
<p class="Pp">Only the officially assigned codes are included.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>* alpha-2, LOCALE_COUNTRY_ALPHA_2, LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2</b></dt>
  <dd>This is the set of two-letter (lowercase) codes from ISO 3166-1, such as
      'tv' for Tuvalu.</dd>
  <dt><b>alpha-3, LOCALE_COUNTRY_ALPHA_3, LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_3</b></dt>
  <dd>This is the set of three-letter (lowercase) codes from ISO 3166-1, such as
      'brb' for Barbados. These codes are actually defined and maintained by the
      U.N. Statistics division.</dd>
  <dt><b>numeric, LOCALE_COUNTRY_NUMERIC, LOCALE_CODE_NUMERIC</b></dt>
  <dd>This is the set of three-digit numeric codes from ISO 3166-1, such as 064
      for Bhutan.
    <p class="Pp">If a 2-digit code is entered, it is converted to 3 digits by
        prepending a 0.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">A list of domain names are maintained by the IANA (Internet
    Assigned Numbers Authority). These are available at:
    &lt;http://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/&gt; . Only the actual country codes
    are used, and the country names come from ISO 3166.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>dom, LOCALE_COUNTRY_DOM, LOCALE_CODE_DOM</b></dt>
  <dd>The country domains assigned by IANA are usually the two-letter
      (lowercase) codes from ISO 3166, but there are a few other additions.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The United Nations also maintains country lists. Their list is
    also similar, but not identical, to the ISO 3166 list.</p>
<p class="Pp">The data is available here:
    &lt;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/&gt;</p>
<p class="Pp">Previously, this table was treated as a source of the ISO 3166
    data, but I found that the table was incomplete, so I stopped using it.
    Later, it was added back in as it's own list of codes.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>un-alpha-3, LOCALE_COUNTRY_UN_ALPHA_3, LOCALE_CODE_UN_ALPHA_3</b></dt>
  <dd>This is similar to the 'alpha-3' set from ISO 3166, except that the codes
      are uppercase.</dd>
  <dt><b>un-numeric, LOCALE_COUNTRY_UN_NUMERIC, LOCALE_CODE_UN_NUMERIC</b></dt>
  <dd>This is similar to the 'numeric' set from ISO 3166.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The US Government also keeps a list of codes. Originally, it
    maintained the FIPS-11 code set, but this was deprecated and replaced by the
    GENC code set. The FIPS-11 code sets are no longer supported by
    <b>Locale-Codes</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The GENC code sets are available here:
    &lt;https://nsgreg.nga.mil/genc/discovery&gt; . They are also similar, but
    not identical, to the ISO 3166 code sets.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>genc-alpha-2, LOCALE_COUNTRY_GENC_ALPHA_2,
    LOCALE_CODE_GENC_ALPHA_2</b></dt>
  <dd>Similar to the 'alpha-2' set, but uppercase.</dd>
  <dt><b>genc-alpha-3, LOCALE_COUNTRY_GENC_ALPHA_3,
    LOCALE_CODE_GENC_ALPHA_3</b></dt>
  <dd>Similar to the 'alpha-3' set, but uppercase.</dd>
  <dt><b>genc-numeric, LOCALE_COUNTRY_GENC_NUMERIC,
    LOCALE_CODE_GENC_NUMERIC</b></dt>
  <dd>Similar to the 'numeric' set.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">There are other sources of codes that are not currently used in
    this distribution.</p>
<p class="Pp">ISO codes for country sub-divisions (states, counties, provinces,
    etc), as defined in ISO 3166-2. This module is not part of the Locale-Codes
    distribution, but is available from CPAN in
  CPAN/modules/by-module/Locale/</p>
<p class="Pp">The World Factbook maintained by the CIA is a potential source of
    the data. Unfortunately, it adds/preserves non-standard codes, so it is not
    used as a source of data.
    &lt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/appendix/print_appendix-d.html&gt;</p>
<p class="Pp">Another unofficial source of data is the Statoids web site:
    &lt;http://www.statoids.com/wab.html&gt; . Currently, it is not used to get
    data, but the notes and explanatory material were very useful for
    understanding discrepancies between the sources.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="language"><a class="permalink" href="#language">language</a></h1>
Code sets for identifying languages come from a couple different locations.
<p class="Pp">The primary source is ISO 639 . The ISO 639-2 codes are available
    here: &lt;http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/&gt; and the ISO 639-5 codes
    are available here: &lt;http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-5/&gt; .</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition, the IANA maintains a language registry which are
    added to the ISO lists. Because it is intended to supplement the ISO
    standard, the IANA list is not separate.</p>
<p class="Pp">The IANA data is available here:
    &lt;http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry&gt;</p>
<p class="Pp">The code sets are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>* alpha-2, LOCALE_LANGUAGE_ALPHA_2, LOCALE_LANG_ALPHA_2</b></dt>
  <dd>This is the set of two-letter (lowercase) codes from ISO 639-1, such as
      'he' for Hebrew. It also includes additions to this set included in the
      IANA language registry.</dd>
  <dt><b>alpha-3, LOCALE_LANGUAGE_ALPHA_3, LOCALE_LANG_ALPHA_3</b></dt>
  <dd>This is the set of three-letter (lowercase) bibliographic codes from ISO
      639-2 and 639-5, such as 'heb' for Hebrew. It also includes additions to
      this set included in the IANA language registry.</dd>
  <dt><b>term, LOCALE_LANGUAGE_TERM, LOCALE_LANG_TERM</b></dt>
  <dd>This is the set of three-letter (lowercase) terminologic codes from ISO
      639.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="currency"><a class="permalink" href="#currency">currency</a></h1>
The source of currency codes is the ISO 4217 data available here:

  <dd>This is a set of three-letter (uppercase) codes from ISO 4217 such as EUR
      for Euro.
    <p class="Pp">Two of the codes specified by the standard (XTS which is
        reserved for testing purposes and XXX which is for transactions where no
        currency is involved) are omitted.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>num, LOCALE_CURRENCY_NUMERIC, LOCALE_CURR_NUMERIC</b></dt>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="NEW_CODE_SETS"><a class="permalink" href="#NEW_CODE_SETS">NEW
  CODE SETS</a></h1>
I'm always open to suggestions for new code sets.
<p class="Pp">In order for me to add a code set, I want the following criteria
    to be met:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>General-use code set</b></dt>
  <dd>If a code set is not general use, I'm not likely to spend the time to add
      and support it.</dd>
  <dt><b>An official source of data</b></dt>
  <dd>I require an official (or at least, a NEARLY official) source where I can
      get the data on a regular basis.
    <p class="Pp">Ideally, I'd only get data from an official source, but
        sometimes that is not possible. For example the ISO standards are not
        typically available for free, so I may have to get some of that data
        from alternate sources that I'm confident are getting their data from
        the official source. However, I will always be hesitant to accept a
        non-official source.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As an example, I used to get some country data from the CIA
        World Factbook. Given the nature of the source, I'm sure they're
        updating data from the official sources and I consider it
        &quot;nearly&quot; official. However, even in this case, I found that
        they were adding codes that were not part of the standard, so I have
        stopped using them as a source.</p>
    <p class="Pp">There are many 3rd party sites which maintain lists (many of
        which are actually in a more convenient form than the official sites).
        Unfortunately, I will reject most of them since I have no feel for how
        &quot;official&quot; they are.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>A free source of the data</b></dt>
  <dd>Obviously, the data must be free-of-charge. I'm not interested in paying
      for the data (and I'm not interested in the overhead of having someone
      else pay for the data for me).</dd>
  <dt><b>A reliable source of data</b></dt>
  <dd>The source of data must come from a source that I can reasonably expect to
      exist for the foreseeable future since I will be extremely reluctant to
      drop support for a data set once it's included.
    <p class="Pp">I am also reluctant to accept data sent to me by an
        individual. Although I appreciate the offer, it is simply not practical
        to consider an individual contribution as a reliable source of data. The
        source should be an official agency of some sort.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">These requirements are open to discussion. If you have a code set
    you'd like to see added, but which may not meet all of the above
    requirements, feel free to email me and we'll discuss it. Depending on
    circumstances, I may be willing to waive some of these criteria.</p>
