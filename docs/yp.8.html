The <code class="Nm">YP</code> subsystem allows network access to directory
  information hosted by NIS servers. OS X support is provided through the
  functions <a class="Xr">getpwent(3)</a>, <a class="Xr">getgrent(3)</a>,
  <a class="Xr">getfsent(3)</a>, <a class="Xr">getnetgrent(3)</a>,
  <a class="Xr">gethostent(3)</a>, <a class="Xr">getnetent(3)</a>,
  <a class="Xr">getrpcent(3)</a>, <a class="Xr">getprotoent(3)</a>,
  <a class="Xr">getservent(3)</a>, <a class="Xr">ethers(3)</a> and other related
  functions. Queries to NIS servers are sent by the
  <code class="Nm">opendirectoryd</code> daemon. The configuration of NIS
  clients is further described in the <a class="Xr">opendirectoryd(8)</a> manual
  page.
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">YP</code> subsystem is started automatically
    by <a class="Xr">launchd(8)</a> if an NIS domain is specified in the
    <span class="Pa">/etc/defaultdomain</span> configuration file, and if the
    directory <span class="Pa">/var/yp</span> exists (which it does in the
    default distribution).</p>
<p class="Pp">NIS is an RPC-based client/server system that allows a group of
    machines within an NIS domain to share a common set of configuration files.
    This permits a system administrator to set up NIS client systems with only
    minimal configuration data and add, remove or modify configuration data from
    a single location.</p>
<p class="Pp">The canonical copies of all NIS information are stored on a single
    machine called the NIS <i class="Em">master server</i>. The databases used
    to store the information are called NIS <i class="Em">maps</i>. A single NIS
    server can support several domains at once, therefore it is possible to have
    several such directories, one for each supported domain. Each domain will
    have its own independent set of maps.</p>
<p class="Pp">Client NIS systems receive all NIS data in ASCII form.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are three main types of NIS systems:</p>
<ol class="Bl-enum">
  <li>NIS clients, which query NIS servers for information.</li>
  <li>NIS master servers, which maintain the canonical copies of all NIS
    maps.</li>
  <li>NIS slave servers, which maintain backup copies of NIS maps that are
      periodically updated by the master.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Pp">OS X systems may be configured as NIS clients, but not as master
    or slave servers.</p>
<p class="Pp">A NIS client establishes what is called a
    <i class="Em">binding</i> to a particular NIS server using the
    <a class="Xr">ypbind(8)</a> daemon. The <a class="Xr">ypbind(8)</a> utility
    checks the system's default domain (as set by the
    <a class="Xr">domainname(1)</a> command) and begins broadcasting RPC
    requests on the local network. These requests specify the name of the domain
    for which <a class="Xr">ypbind(8)</a> is attempting to establish a binding.
    If a server that has been configured to serve the requested domain receives
    one of the broadcasts, it will respond to <a class="Xr">ypbind(8)</a>, which
    will record the server's address. If there are several servers available (a
    master and several slaves, for example), <a class="Xr">ypbind(8)</a> will
    use the address of the first one to respond. From that point on, the client
    system will direct all of its NIS requests to that server. The
    <a class="Xr">ypbind(8)</a> utility will occasionally &#x201C;ping&#x201D;
    the server to make sure it is still up and running. If it fails to receive a
    reply to one of its pings within a reasonable amount of time,
    <a class="Xr">ypbind(8)</a> will mark the domain as unbound and begin
    broadcasting again in the hopes of locating another server.</p>
<p class="Pp">NIS master and slave servers handle all NIS requests with the
    <a class="Xr">ypserv(8)</a> daemon. The <a class="Xr">ypserv(8)</a> utility
    is responsible for receiving incoming requests from NIS clients, translating
    the requested domain and map name to a path to the corresponding database
    file and transmitting data from the database back to the client. There is a
    specific set of requests that <a class="Xr">ypserv(8)</a> is designed to
    handle, most of which are implemented as functions within the standard
    system libraries:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><code class="Fn">yp_order</code>()</dt>
  <dd>check the creation date of a particular map</dd>
  <dt><code class="Fn">yp_master</code>()</dt>
  <dd>obtain the name of the NIS master server for a given map/domain</dd>
  <dt><code class="Fn">yp_match</code>()</dt>
  <dd>lookup the data corresponding to a given in key in a particular
    map/domain</dd>
  <dt><code class="Fn">yp_first</code>()</dt>
  <dd>obtain the first key/data pair in a particular map/domain</dd>
  <dt><code class="Fn">yp_next</code>()</dt>
  <dd>pass <a class="Xr">ypserv(8)</a> a key in a particular map/domain and have
      it return the key/data pair immediately following it (the functions
      <code class="Fn">yp_first</code>() and <code class="Fn">yp_next</code>()
      can be used to do a sequential search of an NIS map)</dd>
  <dt><code class="Fn">yp_all</code>()</dt>
  <dd>retrieve the entire contents of a map</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">There are a few other requests which <a class="Xr">ypserv(8)</a>
    is capable of handling (i.e., acknowledge whether or not you can handle a
    particular domain (<code class="Dv">YPPROC_DOMAIN</code>), or acknowledge
    only if you can handle the domain and be silent otherwise
    (<code class="Dv">YPPROC_DOMAIN_NONACK</code>)) but these requests are
    usually generated only by <a class="Xr">ypbind(8)</a> and are not meant to
    be used by standard utilities.</p>

The <code class="Nm">YP</code> subsystem was written from the ground up by
  <span class="An">Theo de Raadt</span> to be compatible to Sun's
  implementation. Bug fixes, improvements and NIS server support were later
  added by <span class="An">Bill Paul</span>. The server-side code was
  originally written by <span class="An">Peter Eriksson</span> and
  <span class="An">Tobias Reber</span> and is subject to the GNU Public License.
  No Sun code was referenced.
<p class="Pp">OS X NIS client software is derived from FreeBSD.</p>
