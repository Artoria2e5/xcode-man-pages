   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   RCS: @(#) $Id: man.macros,v 1.1 2009/01/30 04:56:47 andreas_kupries Exp $
  
  	# Set up traps and other miscellaneous stuff for Tcl/Tk man pages.
  	# Start an argument description
  .b
  	# define tabbing values for .AP
  
  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location
  	# ^b = 1
  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)
  	Draw four-sided box normally, but don't draw top of
  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar
  	# Special macro to handle page bottom:  finish off current
  	# box/sidebar if in box/sidebar mode, then invoked standard
  	# page bottom macro.
  	Draw three-sided box if this is the box's first page,
  	draw two sides but no top otherwise.
  	# DS - begin display
  	# DE - end display
  	# SO - start of list of standard options
  	# SE - end of list of standard options
  	# OP - start of full description for a single option
  	# CS - begin code excerpt
  	# CE - end code excerpt

Please read the document <i>Name service facility, introduction</i> first.
<p class="Pp">This package provides the <i>exact</i> same API as is provided by
    package <b>nameserv</b>, i.e the regular name service client. It differs
    from the former by taking measures to ensure that longer-lived data, i.e.
    bound names, continuous and unfulfilled async searches, survive the loss of
    the connection to the name server as much as is possible.</p>
<p class="Pp">This means that the bound names and continuous and unfulfilled
    async searches are remembered client-side and automatically re-entered into
    the server when the connection comes back after its loss. For bound names
    there is one important limitation to such restoration: It is possible that a
    name of this client was bound by a different client while the connection was
    gone. Such names are fully lost, and the best the package can and will do is
    to inform the user of this.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="API"><a class="permalink" href="#API">API</a></h1>
The user-visible API is mainly identical the API of <b>nameserv</b> and is
  therefore not described here. Please read the documentation of
  <b>nameserv</b>.
<p class="Pp">The differences are explained in the sections <b>OPTIONS</b> and
    <b>EVENTS</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
This package supports all the option of package <b>nameserv</b>, and one more.
  The additional option allows the user to specifies the time interval between
  attempts to restore a lost connection.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-delay</b> <i>milliseconds</i></dt>
  <dd>The value of this option is an integer value &gt; 0 which specifies the
      interval to wait between attempts to restore a lost connection, in
      milliseconds. The default value is <b>1000</b>, i.e. one second.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EVENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#EVENTS">EVENTS</a></h1>
This package generates all of the events of package <b>nameserv</b>, and two
  more. Both events are generated for the tag <i>nameserv</i>.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>lost-name</i></dt>
  <dd>This event is generated when a bound name is truly lost, i.e. could not be
      restored after the temporary loss of the connection to the name server. It
      indicates that a different client took ownership of the name while this
      client was out of contact.
    <p class="Pp">The detail information of the event will be a Tcl dictionary
        containing two keys, <b>name</b>, and <b>data</b>. Their values hold all
        the information about the lost name.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><i>re-connection</i></dt>
  <dd>This event is generated when the connection to the server is restored. The
      remembered data has been restored when the event is posted.
    <p class="Pp">The event has no detail information.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESIGN"><a class="permalink" href="#DESIGN">DESIGN</a></h1>
The package is implemented on top of the regular nameservice client, i.e.
  package <b>nameserv</b>. It detects the loss of the connection by listening
  for <i>lost-connection</i> events, on the tag <i>nameserv</i>.
<p class="Pp">It reacts to such events by starting a periodic timer and trying
    to reconnect to the server whenver this timer triggers. On success the timer
    is canceled, a <i>re-connection</i> event generated, and the package
    proceeds to re-enter the remembered bound names and continous searches.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another loss of the connection, be it during or after re-entering
    the remembered information simply restarts the timer and subsequent
    reconnection attempts.</p>

This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain bugs and
  other problems. Please report such in the category <i>nameserv</i> of the
  <i>Tcllib SF Trackers</i> [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].
  Please also report any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package
  and/or documentation.
