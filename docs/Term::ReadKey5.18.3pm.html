   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

Term::ReadKey is a compiled perl module dedicated to providing simple control
  over terminal driver modes (cbreak, raw, cooked, etc.,) support for
  non-blocking reads, if the architecture allows, and some generalized handy
  functions for working with terminals. One of the main goals is to have the
  functions as portable as possible, so you can just plug in &quot;use
  Term::ReadKey&quot; on any architecture and have a good likelihood of it
  working.
<p class="Pp">Version 2.30.01: Added handling of arrows, page up/down, home/end,
    insert/delete keys under Win32. These keys emit xterm-compatible sequences.
    Works with Term::ReadLine::Perl.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>ReadMode MODE [, Filehandle]</dt>
  <dd>Takes an integer argument, which can currently be one of the following
      values:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    0    Restore original settings.
    1    Change to cooked mode.
    2    Change to cooked mode with echo off. 
          (Good for passwords)
    3    Change to cbreak mode.
    4    Change to raw mode.
    5    Change to ultra-raw mode. 
          (LF to CR/LF translation turned off) 
          
    Or, you may use the synonyms:
    
    restore
    normal
    noecho
    cbreak
    raw
    ultra-raw
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">These functions are automatically applied to the STDIN handle
        if no other handle is supplied. Modes 0 and 5 have some special
        properties worth mentioning: not only will mode 0 restore original
        settings, but it cause the next ReadMode call to save a new set of
        default settings. Mode 5 is similar to mode 4, except no CR/LF
        translation is performed, and if possible, parity will be disabled (only
        if not being used by the terminal, however. It is no different from mode
        4 under Windows.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you are executing another program that may be changing the
        terminal mode, you will either want to say</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    ReadMode 1
    system('someprogram');
    ReadMode 1;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">which resets the settings after the program has run, or:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    $somemode=1;
    ReadMode 0;
    system('someprogram');
    ReadMode 1;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">which records any changes the program may have made, before
        resetting the mode.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>ReadKey MODE [, Filehandle]</dt>
  <dd>Takes an integer argument, which can currently be one of the following
      values:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    0    Perform a normal read using getc
    -1   Perform a non-blocked read
    &gt;0   Perform a timed read
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">(If the filehandle is not supplied, it will default to STDIN.)
        If there is nothing waiting in the buffer during a non-blocked read,
        then undef will be returned. Note that if the OS does not provide any
        known mechanism for non-blocking reads, then a
        <span class="Li">&quot;ReadKey -1&quot;</span> can die with a fatal
        error. This will hopefully not be common.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If MODE is greater then zero, then ReadKey will use it as a
        timeout value in seconds (fractional seconds are allowed), and won't
        return <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> until that time
        expires. (Note, again, that some OS's may not support this timeout
        behaviour.) If MODE is less then zero, then this is treated as a timeout
        of zero, and thus will return immediately if no character is waiting. A
        MODE of zero, however, will act like a normal getc.</p>
    <p class="Pp">There are currently some limitations with this call under
        Windows. It may be possible that non-blocking reads will fail when
        reading repeating keys from more then one console.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>ReadLine MODE [, Filehandle]</dt>
  <dd>Takes an integer argument, which can currently be one of the following
      values:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    0    Perform a normal read using scalar(&lt;FileHandle&gt;)
    -1   Perform a non-blocked read
    &gt;0   Perform a timed read
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If there is nothing waiting in the buffer during a non-blocked
        read, then undef will be returned. Note that if the OS does not provide
        any known mechanism for non-blocking reads, then a
        <span class="Li">&quot;ReadLine 1&quot;</span> can die with a fatal
        error. This will hopefully not be common. Note that a non-blocking test
        is only performed for the first character in the line, not the entire
        line. This call will probably <b>not</b> do what you assume, especially
        with ReadMode's higher then 1. For example, pressing Space and then
        Backspace would appear to leave you where you started, but any timeouts
        would now be suspended.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This call is currently not available under Windows.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>GetTerminalSize [Filehandle]</dt>
  <dd>Returns either an empty array if this operation is unsupported, or a four
      element array containing: the width of the terminal in characters, the
      height of the terminal in character, the width in pixels, and the height
      in pixels. (The pixel size will only be valid in some environments.)
    <p class="Pp">Under Windows, this function must be called with an
        &quot;output&quot; filehandle, such as STDOUT, or a handle opened to
        CONOUT$.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>SetTerminalSize WIDTH,HEIGHT,XPIX,YPIX [, Filehandle]</dt>
  <dd>Return -1 on failure, 0 otherwise. Note that this terminal size is only
      for <b>informative</b> value, and changing the size via this mechanism
      will <b>not</b> change the size of the screen. For example, XTerm uses a
      call like this when it resizes the screen. If any of the new measurements
      vary from the old, the OS will probably send a SIGWINCH signal to anything
      reading that tty or pty.
    <p class="Pp">This call does not work under Windows.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>GetSpeeds [, Filehandle]</dt>
  <dd>Returns either an empty array if the operation is unsupported, or a two
      value array containing the terminal in and out speeds, in <b>decimal</b>.
      E.g, an in speed of 9600 baud and an out speed of 4800 baud would be
      returned as (9600,4800). Note that currently the in and out speeds will
      always be identical in some OS's. No speeds are reported under
    Windows.</dd>
  <dt>GetControlChars [, Filehandle]</dt>
  <dd>Returns an array containing key/value pairs suitable for a hash. The pairs
      consist of a key, the name of the control character/signal, and the value
      of that character, as a single character. This call does nothing under
      Windows.
    <p class="Pp">Each key will be an entry from the following list:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        DISCARD
        DSUSPEND
        EOF
        EOL
        EOL2
        ERASE
        ERASEWORD
        INTERRUPT
        KILL
        MIN
        QUIT
        QUOTENEXT
        REPRINT
        START
        STATUS
        STOP
        SUSPEND
        SWITCH
        TIME
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Thus, the following will always return the current interrupt
        character, regardless of platform.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        %keys = GetControlChars;
        $int = $keys{INTERRUPT};
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>SetControlChars [, Filehandle]</dt>
  <dd>Takes an array containing key/value pairs, as a hash will produce. The
      pairs should consist of a key that is the name of a legal control
      character/signal, and the value should be either a single character, or a
      number in the range 0-255. SetControlChars will die with a runtime error
      if an invalid character name is passed or there is an error changing the
      settings. The list of valid names is easily available via
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        %cchars = GetControlChars();
        @cnames = keys %cchars;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This call does nothing under Windows.</p>
