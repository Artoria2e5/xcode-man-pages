<b>Certtool</b> is a UNIX command-line program which is used to create key
  pairs, certificates, and certificate signing requests; to import externally
  generated certificates and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) into a
  Keychain, and to display the contents of certificates and CRLs.

<b>Generating a Self-Signed Certificate</b> This command generates a key pair
  and a self-signed (root) certificate and places them in a keychain. The root
  cert is signed by the private key generated during this command. The cert
  generated by this command is totally untrustworthy and cannot be used in the
  &quot;real world&quot;; the primary use of this command is to facilitate early
  development of SSL server applications based on SecureTransport. In
  particular, &quot;real world&quot; SSL clients (e.g., web browsers) will
  complain to varying degrees when they attempt to connect to an SSL server
  which presents a cert which is generated by this command. Some broswers, after
  a fair amount of handholding, will allow you to conditionally
  &quot;trust&quot; this cert.
<pre>
# CertTool c [options]

</pre>
The available options are:
<pre>
k=keyChainName 

</pre>
Where &quot;keyChainName&quot; is the name of the keychain into which keys and
  the cert will be added. The specified keychain must exist. If it doesn't exist
  and you want the keychain created for you, specify the 'c' option. If no
  keychain is specified, keys and certs are added to the default keychain.
<pre>
c 

</pre>
Specifies that the designated keychain is to be created.
<pre>
x=[aSsm]

</pre>
Specifies an optional Extended Key Usage extension. Values are 'a' for
  ExtendedKeyUseAny; 's' for SSL client (ClientAuth); 'S' for SSL server
  (ServerAuth); and 'm' for S/MIME (EmailProtection).
<pre>
a

</pre>
Results the the private key being created with a default ACL. If not specified,
  the private key is created with no ACL.
<pre>
u

</pre>
Create the private key with an ACL limiting access to the current user. This is
  an interactive command; you will be prompted for a number of different items
  which are used to generate the keypair and the cert. A sample session follows.
<pre>
# CertTool k=certkc 
Enter key and certificate label: testCert 
Please specify parameters for the key pair you will generate. 
    r RSA
    d DSA
    f FEE
    e ECDSA
Select key algorithm by letter: r
Valid key sizes for RSA are 1024..2048; default is 2048
Enter key size in bits or CR for default: 2048
You have selected algorithm RSA, key size 2048 bits.
OK (y/anything)? y 
Enter cert/key usage (s=signing, b=signing AND encrypting): b 
 ...Generating key pair... 

</pre>
Note: you will be prompted for the Keychain's passphrase by the Keychain system
  at this point if the specified keychain is not open and you have not specified
  the passphrase via the 'p' option.
<pre>
Please specify the algorithm with which your certificate will be signed. 
    s  RSA with SHA1
    2  RSA with SHA256
    3  RSA with SHA384
    5  RSA with SHA512
Select signature algorithm by letter: s
You have selected algorithm RSA with SHA1. 
OK (y/anything)? y 

</pre>
You will now specify the various components of the certificate's Relative
  Distinguished Name (RDN). An RDN has a number of components, all of which are
  optional, but at least one of which must be present. Note that if you are
  creating a certificate for use in an SSL/TLS server, the Common Name component
  of the RDN must match exactly the host name of the server. This must not be an
  IP address, but the actual domain name, e.g. www.apple.com. Entering a CR for
  a given RDN component results in no value for that component.
<pre>
Common Name       (e.g. www.apple.com) : 10.0.61.5
Country           (e.g. US) : 
Organization      (e.g. Apple, Inc.) : Apple
Organization Unit (e.g. Apple Software Engineering) :
State/Province    (e.g. California) : California 
Email Address     (e.g. username@apple.com) :
You have specified: 
 Common Name	: 10.0.61.5 
 Organization	: Apple 
 State/Province : California 
Is this OK (y/anything)? y 
#

</pre>
The &quot;Common Name&quot; portion of the RDN - in the above case,
  &quot;10.0.61.5&quot; - MUST match the host name of the machine you'll be
  running an SSL/TLS server on. (In this case the test machine doesn't have an
  actual hostname; it's DHCP'd behind a firewall which is why
  &quot;10.0.61.5&quot; was specified for Common Name.) This is part of SSL's
  certificate verification; it prevents an attack using DNS spoofing. A brief
  note about cert/key usage: the normal configuration of SecureTransport is that
  the server cert specified in SSLSetCertificate() is capable of both signing
  and encryption. If this cert is only capable of signing, you must create a
  second keychain containing a cert which is capable of encryption, and pass
  that to SSLSetEncryptionCertificate(). <b>Generating a Certificate Signing
  Request (CSR)</b> A CSR is the standard means by which an administrator of a
  web server provides information to a Certificate Authority (CA) in order to
  obtain a valid certificate which is signed by the CA. This type of cert is
  used in the real world; certs signed by CAs such as Verisign and Thawte are
  recognized by most web browsers when performing SSL transactions. The general
  procedure for obtaining a &quot;real&quot; cert is:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>Generate a key pair</dd>
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>Generate a CSR</dd>
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>Provide the CSR and some other information and/or documentation to the
    CA</dd>
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>CA sends you a certificate which is signed by the CA.</dd>
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>You import that certificate, obtained from the CA, into your keychain. The
      items in that keychain can now be used in SecureTransport's
      SSLSetCertificate() call. This command performs the first two steps in the
      above procedure. See the section below entitled &quot;Importing a
      Certificate&quot; for information on importing the resulting certificate
      into your keychain. The format of this command is
    <pre>
# CertTool r outFileName [options] 

    </pre>
    The resulting CSR will be written to &quot;outFileName&quot;. The available
      options are:
    <pre>
k=keyChainName 

    </pre>
    Where &quot;KeyChainName&quot; is the name of the keychain into which keys
      and the cert will be added. If no keychain is specified, keys and certs
      are added to the default keychain. The specified keychain must exist
      unless you specify the 'c' option.
    <pre>
 d 

    </pre>
    The 'd' option tells CertTool to create the CSR in DER-encoded format. The
      default is PEM-encoded, which is what most CAs expect. PEM encoded data
      consists of printable ASCII text which can, for example, be pasted into an
      email message. DER-encoded data is nonprintable binary data.
    <pre>
 c 

    </pre>
    Specifies that the designated keychain is to be created.
    <pre>
a

    </pre>
    Results the the private key being created with a default ACL. If not
      specified, the private key is created with no ACL.
    <pre>
u

    </pre>
    Create the private key with an ACL limiting access to the current user. This
      is an interactive command; you will be prompted for a number of different
      items which are used to generate the keypair and the CSR. The prompts
      given, and the format of the data you must supply, are identical to the
      data shown in the sample session in Section 2. <b>Verifying a CSR</b> A
      CSR contains, among other things, the public key which was generated in as
      described above. The CSR is signed with the associated private key. Thus
      the integrity of a CSR can be verified by extracting its public key and
      verifying the signature of the CSR. This command performs this integrity
      check. The format of this command is
    <pre>
# CertTool V inFileName [options]

    </pre>
    The only available option is the 'd' flag, which as described above in the
      section entitled &quot;Generating a Certificate Signing Request&quot;,
      indiciates that the CSR is in DER format rather than the default PEM
      format. A typical (successful) run of this command is like so:
    <pre>
# CertTool V myCsr.pem
 ...CSR verified successfully. 

    </pre>
    A large number of things can go wrong if the verification fails; suffice it
      to say that if you see anything other than the above success message, you
      have a bad or corrupted CSR. <b>Creating a System Identity</b> This
      creates a key pair and a self-signed (root) certificate in the System
      keychain, and registers the result in the System Identity database as
      being the IDentity associated with the specified domain name. The domain
      name is typically a string of the form
      &quot;com.apple.somedomain...&quot;. You must be running as root to
      execute this command. The format of this command is
    <pre>
# CertTool C domainName [options] 

    </pre>
    The available options are:
    <pre>
u

    </pre>
    Create the private key with an ACL limiting access to the current user. If
      not specified, the private key wil be created with a default ACL.
    <pre>
P

    </pre>
    Don't create system identity if one already exists for specified domain.
      <b>Importing a Certificate from a Certificate Authority</b> Once you have
      negotiated with your CA, and provided them with the CSR generated as
      described above as well as any other information, documentation, and
      payment they require, the CA will provide you with a certificate. Use this
      command to add that certificate to the keychain containing the keypair you
      generated previously. The format of this command is
    <pre>
# CertTool i inFileName [options] 

    </pre>
    The cert to import is obtained from &quot;inFileName&quot;. The available
      options are:
    <pre>
k=keyChainName 

    </pre>
    Where &quot;keyChainName&quot; is the name of the keychain to which the cert
      will be added. If no keychain is specified, the cert is added to the
      default keychain. The specified keychain typically contains the keypair
      you generated previously. (Note you can import a certificate into a
      keychain which does not contain keys you generated but there will be no
      linkage between the imported certificate and a private key if you do
      this.) If the keychain is not open when this command is executed, you will
      be prompted by the Keychain system for its passphrase.
    <pre>
r=privateKeyFileName

    </pre>
    Where &quot;privateKeyFileName&quot; is the name of the optional private key
      file to imported along with the certificate. This option is used to import
      cert/key pairs which are generated by other means, such as OpenSSL.
    <pre>
f=privateKeyFormat

    </pre>
    Where &quot;privateKeyFormat&quot; is the format of the private key
      specified with the 'r' option. The formats are: '1' for PKCS1 (OpenSSL
      format), '8' (PKCS8), and 'f' (FIPS186, BSAFE format). The default is
      OpenSSL format for both RSA and DSA keys.
    <pre>
 d 

    </pre>
    Specifies DER format as described above. The default is PEM format.
    <pre>
 c 

    </pre>
    Specifies that the designated keychain is to be created. <b>Displaying a
      Certificate</b> This displays the contents of an existing certificate,
      obtained from a file. The format of this command is
    <pre>
# CertTool d inFileName [options] 

    </pre>
    The cert to display is obtained from &quot;inFileName&quot;. The only
      available option is the 'd' flag, specifying DER format as described
      above. The default is PEM format. Actually, in the absence of this option,
      certtool will correctly determine the format of the certificate (PEM or
      DER). <b>Importing a CRL</b> This command is used to add a Certificate
      Revocation List (CRL) to a keychain. The format of this command is
    <pre>
# CertTool I inFileName [options] 

    </pre>
    The CRL to import is obtained from &quot;inFileName&quot;. The available
      options are:
    <pre>
k=keyChainName 

    </pre>
    Where &quot;KeyChainName&quot; is the name of the keychain to which the CRL
      will be added. If no keychain is specified, the cert is added to the
      default keychain. If the keychain is not open when this command is
      executed, you will be prompted by the Keychain system for its passphrase.
    <pre>
 d 

    </pre>
    Specifies DER format as described above. The default is PEM format.
    <pre>
 c 

    </pre>
    Specifies that the designated keychain is to be created. <b>Displaying a
      CRL</b> This displays the contents of an existing Certificate Revocation
      List (CRL), obtained from a file. The format of this command is
    <pre>
# CertTool D inFileName [options] 

    </pre>
    The cert to display is obtained from &quot;inFileName&quot;. The only
      available option is the 'd' flag, specifying DER format as described
      above. The default is PEM format. <b>Displaying Certificates and CRLs in a
      keychain</b> This displays the contents of all certificates and CRLs in a
      keychain. The format of this command is
    <pre>
# CertTool y [options] 

    </pre>
    The available options are:
    <pre>
k=keyChainName 

    </pre>
    Where &quot;KeyChainName&quot; is the name of the keychain to display.
    <pre>
v

    </pre>
    Specifies verbose mode. <b>Certificate Authorities and CSRs</b> As mentioned
      above, the general procedure for obtaining a &quot;real&quot; cert
    is:</dd>
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>Generate a key pair</dd>
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>Generate a CSR</dd>
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>Provide the CSR and some other information and/or documentation to the
    CA</dd>
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>CA sends you a certificate which is signed by the CA.</dd>
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>You import that certificate, obtained from the CA, into your keychain. The
      items in that keychain can now be used in SecureTransport's
      SSLSetCertificate() call. One CA with an excellent web-based interface for
      obtaining a cert is Verisign
      (http://www.verisign.com/products/site/index.html). You can get a free
      14-day trial certificate using nothing but CertTool, Verisign's web site,
      and email. You need to provide some personal information. Paste the CSR
      generated as described in the section entitled &quot;Generating a
      Certificate Signing Request&quot; into a form on the web site. A few
      minutes later Verisign emails you a certificate, which you import into
      your keychain. The whole process takes less than 10 minutes. The free
      certificate obtained in this manner is signed by a temporary root cert
      which is not recognized by any browsers, but Verisign also provides a
      means of installing this temporary root cert into your browser, directly
      from their web site. Typically one would use the free, temporary cert to
      perform initial configuration of a server and to ring out the general SSL
      infrastructure. Once you feel comfortable with the operation of the
      server, then it's time to buy a &quot;real&quot; certificate which will
      allow your web server to be trusted by any browser. Thawte has a similar,
      very friendly service at http://www.thawte.com/. Note that, for early web
      server development and/or testing, you can skip the entire procedure
      described above and just generate your own self-signed root cert as
      described above. No CA is involved; no CSR is generated; no cert needs to
      be imported - CertTool generates a cert for you and immediately adds it to
      your keychain. Bear in mind that this option will require support from
      various SSL clients you'll be testing with, none of which recognize your
      root cert.</dd>
