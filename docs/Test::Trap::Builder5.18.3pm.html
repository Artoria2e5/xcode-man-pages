Test::Trap neither traps nor tests everything you may want to trap or test. So,
  Test::Trap::Builder provides methods to write your own trap layers, accessors,
  and test callbacks -- preferably for use with your own modules (trappers).
<p class="Pp">Note that layers are methods with mangled names (names are
    prefixed with <span class="Li">&quot;layer:&quot;</span>), and so inherited
    like any other method, while accessors are ordinary methods. Meanwhile, test
    callbacks are not referenced in the symbol table by themselves, but only in
    combinations with accessors, all methods of the form
    <i>ACCESSOR</i>_<i>TEST</i>.</p>
</section>

<h1 class="Sh" id="EXPORTS"><a class="permalink" href="#EXPORTS">EXPORTS</a></h1>
Trappers should not inherit from Test::Trap::Builder, but may import a few
  convenience methods for use in building the trap. Do not use them as methods
  of Test::Trap::Builder -- they are intended to be methods of trap objects. (If
  you inherit from another trapper, you need not, and probably should not,
  import these yourself -- you should inherit these methods like any other.)
<p class="Pp">Trappers may import any number of these methods, or all of them by
    way of the <span class="Li">&quot;:methods&quot;</span> tag.</p>
<p class="Pp">Layers should be implemented as methods, and while they need not
    call any of these convenience methods in turn, that likely makes for more
    readable code than any alternative. Likewise, test callbacks may use
    convenience methods for more readable code.</p>
<p class="Pp">Of course, certain convenience methods may also be useful in more
    generic methods messing with trap or builder objects.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Prop___s-1PACKAGE_s0_"><a class="permalink" href="#Prop___s-1PACKAGE_s0_">Prop
  [PACKAGE]</a></h2>
A method returning a reference to a hash, holding the <i>PACKAGE</i>'s (by
  default the caller's) tag-on properties for the (current) trap object.
  Currently, Test::Trap::Builder defines the following properties:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>layers</dt>
  <dd>While the trap is springing, the queue of layers remaining. Usually set by
      the &quot;trap&quot; method and consumed by the &quot;Next&quot;
    method.</dd>
  <dt>teardown</dt>
  <dd>While the trap is springing, the queue of teardown actions remaining.
      Usually accumulated through the &quot;Teardown&quot; method and invoked by
      the &quot;trap&quot; method.</dd>
  <dt>code</dt>
  <dd>The user code trapped. Usually set by the &quot;trap&quot; method and
      invoked by the &quot;Run&quot; method.</dd>
  <dt>exception</dt>
  <dd>An internal exception. Usually set through the &quot;Exception&quot;
      method and examined by the &quot;trap&quot; method.</dd>
  <dt>on_test_failure</dt>
  <dd>A callback invoked by the &quot;TestFailure&quot; method. Layers in
      particular may want to set this.</dd>
  <dt>test_accessor</dt>
  <dd>The name and (optionally) the index of the accessor, the contents of which
      we're currently testing. Best accessed through the
      &quot;TestAccessor&quot; method, and usually set by the &quot;test&quot;
      and &quot;accessor&quot; methods, but if you are writing your own tests or
      accessors directly, you just might need to set it. Perhaps.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Be nice: Treat another module's tag-on properties as you would
    treat another module's global variables. Don't use them except as
    documented.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  # in a layer, setting the callback for TestFailure:
  $self-&gt;Prop('Test::Trap::Builder')-&gt;{on_test_failure} = \&amp;mydiag;
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_s-1DESTROY_s0"><a class="permalink" href="#_s-1DESTROY_s0">DESTROY</a></h2>
This cleans up the tag-on properties when the trap object is destroyed. Don't
  try to make a trapper that doesn't call this; it will get confused.
<p class="Pp">If your trapper needs its own
    <span class="Li">&quot;DESTROY&quot;</span>, make sure it calls this one as
    well:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  sub DESTROY {
    my $self = shift;
    # do your thing
    $self-&gt;Test::Trap::Builder::DESTROY;
    # and more things
  }
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Run"><a class="permalink" href="#Run">Run</a></h2>
A terminating layer should call this method to run the user code. Should only be
  called in a dynamic context in which layers are being applied.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Next"><a class="permalink" href="#Next">Next</a></h2>
Every non-terminating layer should call this method (or an equivalent) to
  progress to the next layer. Should only be called in a dynamic context in
  which layers are being applied. Note that this method need not return, so any
  tear-down actions should probably be registered with the Teardown method (see
  below).
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Teardown__s-1SUBS_s0"><a class="permalink" href="#Teardown__s-1SUBS_s0">Teardown
  SUBS</a></h2>
If your layer wants to clean up its setup, it may use this method to register
  any number of tear-down actions, to be performed (in reverse registration
  order) once the user code has been executed. Should only be called in a
  dynamic context in which layers are being applied.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="TestAccessor"><a class="permalink" href="#TestAccessor">TestAccessor</a></h2>
Returns a string of the form
  <span class="Li">&quot;</span><i>NAME</i><span class="Li">(</span><i>INDEX</i><span class="Li">)&quot;</span>,
  where <i>NAME</i> and <i>INDEX</i> are the name of the accessor and the index
  (if any) being tested. Should only be called in the dynamic context of test
  callbacks.
<p class="Pp">This is intended for diagnostics:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  diag( sprintf 'Expected %s in %s; got %s',
        $expected, $self-&gt;TestAccessor, dump($got),
      );
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="TestFailure"><a class="permalink" href="#TestFailure">TestFailure</a></h2>
Runs the <span class="Li">&quot;on_test_failure&quot;</span> tag-on property (if
  any) on the trap object. If you are writing unregistered tests, you might want
  to include (some variation of) this call:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
  $ok or $self-&gt;TestFailure;
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Exception__s-1STRINGS_s0"><a class="permalink" href="#Exception__s-1STRINGS_s0">Exception
  STRINGS</a></h2>
Layer implementations may run into exceptional situations, in which they want
  the entire trap to fail. Unfortunately, another layer may be trapping ordinary
  exceptions, so you need some kind of magic in order to throw an untrappable
  exception. This is one convenient way.
<p class="Pp">Should only be called in a dynamic context in which layers are
    being applied.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: The Exception method won't work if called from outside of
    the regular control flow, like inside a DESTROY method or signal handler. If
    anything like this happens, CORE::exit will be called with an exit code of
    8.</p>

  TRAPPER, GLOBREF, LAYERARRAYREF, CODE</a></h2>
Implements a trap for the <i>TRAPPER</i> module, applying the layers of
  <i>LAYERARRAYREF</i>, trapping various outcomes of the user <i>CODE</i>, and
  storing the trap object into the scalar slot of <i>GLOBREF</i>.
<p class="Pp">In most cases, the trapper should conveniently export a function

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="layer__s-1NAME,_CODE_s0"><a class="permalink" href="#layer__s-1NAME,_CODE_s0">layer
  NAME, CODE</a></h2>
Registers a layer by <i>NAME</i> to the calling trapper. When the layer is
  applied, the <i>CODE</i> will be invoked on the trap object being built, with
  no arguments, and should call either the <i>Next()</i> or <i>Run()</i> method
  or equivalent.

Registers (by <i>NAME</i> and to the calling trapper) a layer for trapping
  output on the file handle of the <i>GLOBREF</i>, using <i>NAME</i> also as the
  attribute name.

  NAME, [CODE]</a></h2>
When called with two arguments, registers (by <i>NAME</i> and globally) a
  backend for output trap layers. When called with a single argument, looks up
  and returns the backend registered by <i>NAME</i> (or undef).
<p class="Pp">When a layer using this backend is applied, the <i>CODE</i> will
    be called on the trap object, with the layer name and the output handle's

Where <i>SPEC</i> is empty, just returns.
<p class="Pp">Where <i>SPEC</i> is a string of comma-or-semicolon separated
    backend names, runs through the names, returning the first implementation it

Registers (by <i>NAME</i>) a layer that just pushes a number of other

  NAMED_ARGS</a></h2>
Generates and registers any number of accessors according to the
  <i>NAMED_ARGS</i>, and also generates the proper test methods for these
  accessors (see below).
<p class="Pp">The following named arguments are recognized:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>is_leaveby</dt>
  <dd>If true, the tests methods will generate better diagnostics if the trap

      will be generated (unless already present), simply passing as long as the
      trap was left as specified.</dd>
  <dt>is_array</dt>
  <dd>If true, the simple accessor(s) will be smart about context and arguments,
      returning an arrayref on no argument (in any context), an array slice in

      first argument otherwise.</dd>
  <dt>simple</dt>
  <dd>Should be a reference to an array of accessor names. For each name, an

<h2 class="Ss" id="test__s-1NAME,_ARGSPEC,_CODE_s0"><a class="permalink" href="#test__s-1NAME,_ARGSPEC,_CODE_s0">test
  NAME, ARGSPEC, CODE</a></h2>
Registers a test callback by <i>NAME</i> and to the calling trapper.
<p class="Pp">Trappers inherit test callbacks like methods (though they are not
    implemented as such; don't expect to find them in the symbol table).</p>
<p class="Pp">Test methods of the form <i>ACCESSOR</i>_<i>TEST</i> will be made
    available (directly or by inheritance) to every trapper that registers or
    inherits both the accessor named <i>ACCESSOR</i> and the test named
    <i>TEST</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">(In more detail, the method will be generated in every trapper
    that either (1) registers both the test and the accessor, or (2) registers
    either and inherits the other.)</p>
<p class="Pp">When the test method is called, any implicit leaveby condition
    will be tested first, and if it passes (or there were none), the <i>CODE</i>
    is called with arguments according to the words found in the <i>ARGSPEC</i>

  <dd>The <i>ACCESSOR</i>'s return value when called with index, if applicable
      (i.e. for array accessors). Index is not applicable to scalar accessors,
      so such are still called without index.
    <p class="Pp">The index, when applicable, will be taken from the test
        method's arguments.</p>
