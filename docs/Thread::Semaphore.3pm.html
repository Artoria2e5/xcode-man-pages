   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

Semaphores provide a mechanism to regulate access to resources. Unlike locks,
  semaphores aren't tied to particular scalars, and so may be used to control
  access to anything you care to use them for.
<p class="Pp">Semaphores don't limit their values to zero and one, so they can
    be used to control access to some resource that there may be more than one
    of (e.g., filehandles). Increment and decrement amounts aren't fixed at one
    either, so threads can reserve or return multiple resources at once.</p>

  <dt>-&gt;<i>new()</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>-&gt;new(NUMBER)</dt>
  <dd><span class="Li">&quot;new&quot;</span> creates a new semaphore, and
      initializes its count to the specified number (which must be an integer).
      If no number is specified, the semaphore's count defaults to 1.</dd>
  <dt>-&gt;<i>down()</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>-&gt;down(NUMBER)</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;down&quot;</span> method decreases the
      semaphore's count by the specified number (which must be an integer &gt;=
      1), or by one if no number is specified.
    <p class="Pp">If the semaphore's count would drop below zero, this method
        will block until such time as the semaphore's count is greater than or
        equal to the amount you're <span class="Li">&quot;down&quot;</span>ing
        the semaphore's count by.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This is the semaphore &quot;P operation&quot; (the name
        derives from the Dutch word &quot;pak&quot;, which means
        &quot;capture&quot; -- the semaphore operations were named by the late
        Dijkstra, who was Dutch).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-&gt;<i>down_nb()</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>-&gt;down_nb(NUMBER)</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;down_nb&quot;</span> method attempts to
      decrease the semaphore's count by the specified number (which must be an
      integer &gt;= 1), or by one if no number is specified.
    <p class="Pp">If the semaphore's count would drop below zero, this method
        will return <i>false</i>, and the semaphore's count remains unchanged.
        Otherwise, the semaphore's count is decremented and this method returns
        <i>true</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-&gt;<i>down_force()</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>-&gt;down_force(NUMBER)</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;down_force&quot;</span> method decreases the
      semaphore's count by the specified number (which must be an integer &gt;=
      1), or by one if no number is specified. This method does not block, and
      may cause the semaphore's count to drop below zero.</dd>
  <dt>-&gt;<i>up()</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>-&gt;up(NUMBER)</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;up&quot;</span> method increases the
      semaphore's count by the number specified (which must be an integer &gt;=
      1), or by one if no number is specified.
    <p class="Pp">This will unblock any thread that is blocked trying to
        <span class="Li">&quot;down&quot;</span> the semaphore if the
        <span class="Li">&quot;up&quot;</span> raises the semaphore's count
        above the amount that the <span class="Li">&quot;down&quot;</span> is
        trying to decrement it by. For example, if three threads are blocked
        trying to <span class="Li">&quot;down&quot;</span> a semaphore by one,
        and another thread <span class="Li">&quot;up&quot;</span>s the semaphore
        by two, then two of the blocked threads (which two is indeterminate)
        will become unblocked.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This is the semaphore &quot;V operation&quot; (the name
        derives from the Dutch word &quot;vrij&quot;, which means
        &quot;release&quot;).</p>

Semaphores created by Thread::Semaphore can be used in both threaded and
  non-threaded applications. This allows you to write modules and packages that
  potentially make use of semaphores, and that will function in either
  environment.
