This function sets up the program environment that libcurl needs. Think of it as
  an extension of the library loader.
<p class="Pp">This function must be called at least once within a program (a
    program is all the code that shares a memory space) before the program calls
    any other function in libcurl. The environment it sets up is constant for
    the life of the program and is the same for every program, so multiple calls
    have the same effect as one call.</p>
<p class="Pp">The flags option is a bit pattern that tells libcurl exactly what
    features to init, as described below. Set the desired bits by ORing the
    values together. In normal operation, you must specify CURL_GLOBAL_ALL.
    Don't use any other value unless you are familiar with it and mean to
    control internal operations of libcurl.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>This function is not thread safe.</b> You must not call it when
    any other thread in the program (i.e. a thread sharing the same memory) is
    running. This doesn't just mean no other thread that is using libcurl.
    Because <i>curl_global_init(3)</i> calls functions of other libraries that
    are similarly thread unsafe, it could conflict with any other thread that
    uses these other libraries.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are initializing libcurl from a Windows DLL you should not
    initialize it from DllMain or a static initializer because Windows holds the
    loader lock during that time and it could cause a deadlock.</p>
<p class="Pp">See the description in <i>libcurl(3)</i> of global environment
    requirements for details of how to use this function.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="FLAGS"><a class="permalink" href="#FLAGS">FLAGS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>CURL_GLOBAL_ALL</dt>
  <dd>Initialize everything possible. This sets all known bits except
      <b>CURL_GLOBAL_ACK_EINTR</b>.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt>CURL_GLOBAL_SSL</dt>
  <dd>(This flag's presence or absence serves no meaning since 7.57.0. The
      description below is for older libcurl versions.)
    <p class="Pp">Initialize SSL.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The implication here is that if this bit is not set, the
        initialization of the SSL layer needs to be done by the application or
        at least outside of libcurl. The exact procedure how to do SSL
        initialization depends on the TLS backend libcurl uses.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Doing TLS based transfers without having the TLS layer
        initialized may lead to unexpected behaviors.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>CURL_GLOBAL_WIN32</dt>
  <dd>Initialize the Win32 socket libraries.
    <p class="Pp">The implication here is that if this bit is not set, the
        initialization of winsock has to be done by the application or you risk
        getting undefined behaviors. This option exists for when the
        initialization is handled outside of libcurl so there's no need for
        libcurl to do it again.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>CURL_GLOBAL_NOTHING</dt>
  <dd>Initialise nothing extra. This sets no bit.</dd>
  <dt>CURL_GLOBAL_DEFAULT</dt>
  <dd>A sensible default. It will init both SSL and Win32. Right now, this
      equals the functionality of the <b>CURL_GLOBAL_ALL</b> mask.</dd>
  <dt>CURL_GLOBAL_ACK_EINTR</dt>
  <dd>When this flag is set, curl will acknowledge EINTR condition when
      connecting or when waiting for data. Otherwise, curl waits until full
      timeout elapses. (Added in 7.30.0)</dd>

If this function returns non-zero, something went wrong and you cannot use the
  other curl functions.
