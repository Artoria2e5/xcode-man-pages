The <code class="Nm">arch</code> command with no arguments, displays the
  machine's architecture type.
<p class="Pp">The other use of the <code class="Nm">arch</code> command is to
    run a selected architecture of a universal binary. A universal binary
    contains code that can run on different architectures. By default, the
    operating system will select the architecture that most closely matches the
    processor type. A 64-bit architecture is preferred over a 32-bit
    architecture on a 64-bit processor, while only 32-bit architectures can run
    on a 32-bit processor.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the most natural architecture is unavailable, the operating
    system will try to pick another architecture. On 64-bit processors, a 32-bit
    architecture is tried. Otherwise, no architecture is run, and an error
    results.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">arch</code> command can be used to alter the
    operating system's normal selection order. The most common use is to select
    the 32-bit architecture on a 64-bit processor, even if a 64-bit architecture
    is available.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Ar">arch_name</var> argument must be one of the
    currently supported architectures:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>i386</dt>
  <dd>32-bit intel</dd>
  <dt>x86_64</dt>
  <dd>64-bit intel</dd>
  <dt>x86_64h</dt>
  <dd>64-bit intel (haswell)</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Either prefix the architecture with a hyphen, or (for
    compatibility with other commands), use <code class="Fl">-arch</code>
    followed by the architecture.</p>
<p class="Pp">If more than one architecture is specified, the operating system
    will try each one in order, skipping an architecture that is not supported
    on the current processor, or is unavailable in the universal binary.</p>
<p class="Pp">The other options are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#32"><code class="Fl" id="32">-32</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Add the native 32-bit architecture to the list of architectures.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#64"><code class="Fl" id="64">-64</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Add the native 64-bit architecture to the list of architectures.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#c"><code class="Fl" id="c">-c</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Clears the environment that will be passed to the command to be run.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#d"><code class="Fl" id="d">-d</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">envname</var></dt>
  <dd>Deletes the named environment variable from the environment that will be
      passed to the command to be run.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#e"><code class="Fl" id="e">-e</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">envname=value</var></dt>
  <dd>Assigns the given value to the named environment variable in the
      environment that will be passed to the command to be run. Any existing
      environment variable with the same name will be replaced.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#h"><code class="Fl" id="h">-h</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Prints a usage message and exits.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Ar">prog</var> argument is the command to run,
    followed by any arguments to pass to the command. It can be a full or
    partial path, while a lone name will be looked up in the user's command
    search path.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no architectures are specified on the command line, the
    <code class="Nm">arch</code> command takes the basename of the
    <var class="Ar">prog</var> argument and searches for the first property list
    file with that basename and the <span class="Pa">.plist</span> suffix, in
    the <span class="Pa">archSettings</span> sub-directory in each of the
    standard domains, in the following order:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>~/Library/archSettings</dt>
  <dd>User settings</dd>
  <dt>/Library/archSettings</dt>
  <dd>Local settings</dd>
  <dt>/Network/Library/archSettings</dt>
  <dd>Network settings</dd>
  <dt>/System/Library/archSettings</dt>
  <dd>System settings</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This property list contains the architecture order preferences, as
    well as the full path to the real executable. For examples of the property
    list format, look at the files in
    <span class="Pa">/System/Library/archSettings</span>.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Making_links_to_the_arch_command"><a class="permalink" href="#Making_links_to_the_arch_command">Making
  links to the arch command</a></h2>
When a link is made to <code class="Nm">arch</code> command with a different
  name, that name is used to find the corresponding property list file. Thus,
  other commands can be wrapped so that they have custom architecture selection
  order.
<p class="Pp">Because of some internal logic in the code, hard links to the
    <code class="Nm">arch</code> command may not work quite right. It is best to
    avoid using hard links, and only use symbolic links to the
    <code class="Nm">arch</code> command.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Environment"><a class="permalink" href="#Environment">Environment</a></h2>
The environment variable <code class="Ev">ARCHPREFERENCE</code> can be used to
  provide architecture order preferences. It is checked before looking for the
  corresponding property list file.
<p class="Pp">The value of the environment variable
    <code class="Ev">ARCHPREFERENCE</code> is composed of one or more
    specifiers, separated by semicolons. A specifier is made up of one, two or
    three fields, separated by colons. Architectures specified in order, are
    separated by commas and make up the last (mandatory) field. The first field,
    if specified, is a name of a program, which selects this specifier if that
    name matches the program name in question. If the name field is empty or
    there is no name field, the specifier matches any program name. Thus,
    ordering of specifiers is important, and the one with no name should be
    last.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the <code class="Nm">arch</code> command is called directly,
    the <var class="Ar">prog</var> name provides the path information to the
    executable (possibly via the command search path). When a name is specified
    in a <code class="Ev">ARCHPREFERENCE</code> specifier, the path information
    can alternately be specified as a second field following the name. When the
    <code class="Nm">arch</code> command is called indirectly via a link, this
    path information must be specified. If not specified as a second field in a
    specifier, the executable path will be looked up in the corresponding
    property list file.</p>

Running the <code class="Nm">arch</code> command on an interpreter script may
  not work if the interpreter is a link to the arch command, especially if a
  64-bit architecture is specified (since the <code class="Nm">arch</code>
  command is 2-way universal, 32-bit only).
