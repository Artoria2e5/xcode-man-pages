   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will
   give an unbreakable dash, \*(PI will give pi, \*(L" will give a left
   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

This document describes differences between the 5.16.2 release and the 5.16.3
  release.
<p class="Pp">If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.16.1, first
    read perl5162delta, which describes differences between 5.16.1 and
  5.16.2.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Security"><a class="permalink" href="#Security">Security</a></h1>
This release contains one major and a number of minor security fixes. These
  latter are included mainly to allow the test suite to pass cleanly with the
  clang compiler's address sanitizer facility.

  memory exhaustion with arbitrary hash keys</a></h2>
With a carefully crafted set of hash keys (for example arguments on a URL), it
  is possible to cause a hash to consume a large amount of memory and CPU, and
  thus possibly to achieve a Denial-of-Service.
<p class="Pp">This problem has been fixed.</p>

Perl 5.16.3 represents approximately 4 months of development since Perl 5.16.2
  and contains approximately 870 lines of changes across 39 files from 7
  authors.
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.16.3:</p>
<p class="Pp">Andy Dougherty, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dave Rolsky, David
    Mitchell, Michael Schroeder, Ricardo Signes, Yves Orton.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,
    please see the <i>AUTHORS</i> file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Reporting_Bugs"><a class="permalink" href="#Reporting_Bugs">Reporting
  Bugs</a></h1>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at
  http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
    program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny
    but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
    send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
    subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
    committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out
    a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix
    the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use
    this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules
    independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
