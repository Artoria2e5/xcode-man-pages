<code class="Fn">ptrace</code>() provides tracing and debugging facilities. It
  allows one process (the <i class="Em">tracing</i> process) to control another
  (the <i class="Em">traced</i> process). Most of the time, the traced process
  runs normally, but when it receives a signal (see
  <a class="Xr">sigaction(2)</a>), it stops. The tracing process is expected to
  notice this via <a class="Xr">wait(2)</a> or the delivery of a
  <code class="Dv">SIGCHLD</code> signal, examine the state of the stopped
  process, and cause it to terminate or continue as appropriate.
  <code class="Fn">ptrace</code>() is the mechanism by which all this happens.
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Fa">request</var> argument specifies what
    operation is being performed; the meaning of the rest of the arguments
    depends on the operation, but except for one special case noted below, all
    <code class="Fn">ptrace</code>() calls are made by the tracing process, and
    the <var class="Fa">pid</var> argument specifies the process ID of the
    traced process. <var class="Fa">request</var> can be:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#PT_TRACE_ME"><code class="Dv" id="PT_TRACE_ME">PT_TRACE_ME</code></a></dt>
  <dd>This request is one of two used by the traced process; it declares that
      the process expects to be traced by its parent. All the other arguments
      are ignored. (If the parent process does not expect to trace the child, it
      will probably be rather confused by the results; once the traced process
      stops, it cannot be made to continue except via
      <code class="Fn">ptrace</code>().) When a process has used this request
      and calls <a class="Xr">execve(2)</a> or any of the routines built on it
      (such as <a class="Xr">execv(3)</a>), it will stop before executing the
      first instruction of the new image. Also, any setuid or setgid bits on the
      executable being executed will be ignored.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#PT_DENY_ATTACH"><code class="Dv" id="PT_DENY_ATTACH">PT_DENY_ATTACH</code></a></dt>
  <dd>This request is the other operation used by the traced process; it allows
      a process that is not currently being traced to deny future traces by its
      parent. All other arguments are ignored. If the process is currently being
      traced, it will exit with the exit status of ENOTSUP; otherwise, it sets a
      flag that denies future traces. An attempt by the parent to trace a
      process which has set this flag will result in a segmentation violation in
      the parent.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#PT_CONTINUE"><code class="Dv" id="PT_CONTINUE">PT_CONTINUE</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The traced process continues execution. <var class="Fa">addr</var> is an
      address specifying the place where execution is to be resumed (a new value
      for the program counter), or <code class="Li">(caddr_t)1</code> to
      indicate that execution is to pick up where it left off.
      <var class="Fa">data</var> provides a signal number to be delivered to the
      traced process as it resumes execution, or 0 if no signal is to be
    sent.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#PT_STEP"><code class="Dv" id="PT_STEP">PT_STEP</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The traced process continues execution for a single step. The parameters
      are identical to those passed to <code class="Dv">PT_CONTINUE.</code></dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#PT_KILL"><code class="Dv" id="PT_KILL">PT_KILL</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The traced process terminates, as if <code class="Dv">PT_CONTINUE</code>
      had been used with <code class="Dv">SIGKILL</code> given as the signal to
      be delivered.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#PT_ATTACH"><code class="Dv" id="PT_ATTACH">PT_ATTACH</code></a></dt>
  <dd>This call has been replaced with PT_ATTACHEXC.</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#PT_ATTACHEXC"><code class="Dv" id="PT_ATTACHEXC">PT_ATTACHEXC</code></a></dt>
  <dd>This request allows a process to gain control of an otherwise unrelated
      process and begin tracing it. It does not need any cooperation from the
      to-be-traced process. In this case, <var class="Fa">pid</var> specifies
      the process ID of the to-be-traced process, and the other two arguments
      are ignored. This request requires that the target process must have the
      same real UID as the tracing process, and that it must not be executing a
      setuid or setgid executable. (If the tracing process is running as root,
      these restrictions do not apply.) The tracing process will see the
      newly-traced process stop and may then control it as if it had been traced
      all along. Note that this call differs from the prior call (
      <code class="Dv">PT_ATTACH</code>) in that signals from the child are
      delivered to the parent as Mach exceptions (see EXC_SOFT_SIGNAL).</dd>
  <dt><a class="permalink" href="#PT_DETACH"><code class="Dv" id="PT_DETACH">PT_DETACH</code></a></dt>
  <dd>This request is like PT_CONTINUE, except that it does not allow specifying
      an alternate place to continue execution, and after it succeeds, the
      traced process is no longer traced and continues execution normally.</dd>

Some requests can cause <code class="Fn">ptrace</code>() to return
  <code class="Li">-1</code> as a non-error value; to disambiguate,
  <var class="Va">errno</var> can be set to 0 before the call and checked
  afterwards. The possible errors are:
