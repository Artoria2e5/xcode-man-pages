   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

  	# Set up traps and other miscellaneous stuff for Tcl/Tk man pages.
  	# Start an argument description
  .b
  	# define tabbing values for .AP
  
  	# BS - start boxed text
  	# ^y = starting y location
  	# ^b = 1
  	# BE - end boxed text (draw box now)
  	Draw four-sided box normally, but don't draw top of
  	box if the box started on an earlier page.
  	# VS - start vertical sidebar
  	# ^Y = starting y location
  	# ^v = 1 (for troff;  for nroff this doesn't matter)
  	# VE - end of vertical sidebar
  	# Special macro to handle page bottom:  finish off current
  	# box/sidebar if in box/sidebar mode, then invoked standard
  	# page bottom macro.
  	Draw three-sided box if this is the box's first page,
  	draw two sides but no top otherwise.
  	# DS - begin display
  	# DE - end display
  	# SO - start of list of standard options
  	# SE - end of list of standard options
  	# OP - start of full description for a single option
  	# CS - begin code excerpt
  	# CE - end code excerpt
  	# UL - underline word
  	# QW - apply quotation marks to word
  " fix emacs highlighting
  	# PQ - apply parens and quotation marks to word

  	# QR - quoted range

The <b>history</b> command performs one of several operations related to
  recently-executed commands recorded in a history list. Each of these recorded
  commands is referred to as an &#x201C;event&#x201D;. When specifying an event
  to the <b>history</b> command, the following forms may be used:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>A number: if positive, it refers to the event with that number (all events
      are numbered starting at 1). If the number is negative, it selects an
      event relative to the current event (<b>-1</b> refers to the previous
      event, <b>-2</b> to the one before that, and so on). Event <b>0</b> refers
      to the current event.</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>A string: selects the most recent event that matches the string. An event
      is considered to match the string either if the string is the same as the
      first characters of the event, or if the string matches the event in the
      sense of the <b>string match</b> command.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The <b>history</b> command can take any of the following
  forms:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>history</b></dt>
  <dd>Same as <b>history info</b>, described below.</dd>
  <dt><b>history add</b><i> command </i>?<b>exec</b>?</dt>
  <dd>Adds the <i>command</i> argument to the history list as a new event. If
      <b>exec</b> is specified (or abbreviated) then the command is also
      executed and its result is returned. If <b>exec</b> is not specified then
      an empty string is returned as result.</dd>
  <dt><b>history change</b><i> newValue</i> ?<i>event</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Replaces the value recorded for an event with <i>newValue</i>.
      <i>Event</i> specifies the event to replace, and defaults to the
      <i>current</i> event (not event <b>-1</b>). This command is intended for
      use in commands that implement new forms of history substitution and wish
      to replace the current event (which invokes the substitution) with the
      command created through substitution. The return value is an empty
    string.</dd>
  <dt><b>history clear</b></dt>
  <dd>Erase the history list. The current keep limit is retained. The history
      event numbers are reset.</dd>
  <dt><b>history event</b> ?<i>event</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Returns the value of the event given by <i>event</i>. <i>Event</i>
      defaults to <b>-1</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>history info </b>?<i>count</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Returns a formatted string (intended for humans to read) giving the event
      number and contents for each of the events in the history list except the
      current event. If <i>count</i> is specified then only the most recent
      <i>count</i> events are returned.</dd>
  <dt><b>history keep </b>?<i>count</i>?</dt>
  <dd>This command may be used to change the size of the history list to
      <i>count</i> events. Initially, 20 events are retained in the history
      list. If <i>count</i> is not specified, the current keep limit is
      returned.</dd>
  <dt><b>history nextid</b></dt>
  <dd>Returns the number of the next event to be recorded in the history list.
      It is useful for things like printing the event number in command-line
      prompts.</dd>
  <dt><b>history redo </b>?<i>event</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Re-executes the command indicated by <i>event</i> and returns its result.
      <i>Event</i> defaults to <b>-1</b>. This command results in history
      revision: see below for details.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="HISTORY_REVISION"><a class="permalink" href="#HISTORY_REVISION">HISTORY
  REVISION</a></h1>
Pre-8.0 Tcl had a complex history revision mechanism. The current mechanism is
  more limited, and the old history operations <b>substitute</b> and
  <b>words</b> have been removed. (As a consolation, the <b>clear</b> operation
  was added.)
<p class="Pp">The history option <b>redo</b> results in much simpler
    &#x201C;history revision&#x201D;. When this option is invoked then the most
    recent event is modified to eliminate the history command and replace it
    with the result of the history command. If you want to redo an event without
    modifying history, then use the <b>event</b> operation to retrieve some
    event, and the <b>add</b> operation to add it to history and execute it.</p>
