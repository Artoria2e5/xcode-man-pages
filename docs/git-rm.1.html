Remove files matching pathspec from the index, or from the working tree and the
  index. <b>git rm</b> will not remove a file from just your working directory.
  (There is no option to remove a file only from the working tree and yet keep
  it in the index; use <b>/bin/rm</b> if you want to do that.) The files being
  removed have to be identical to the tip of the branch, and no updates to their
  contents can be staged in the index, though that default behavior can be
  overridden with the <b>-f</b> option. When <b>--cached</b> is given, the
  staged content has to match either the tip of the branch or the file on disk,
  allowing the file to be removed from just the index.

<div class="Bd-indent">Files to remove. A leading directory name (e.g.
  <b>dir</b> to remove <b>dir/file1</b> and <b>dir/file2</b>) can be given to
  remove all files in the directory, and recursively all sub-directories, but
  this requires the <b>-r</b> option to be explicitly given.
<p class="Pp">The command removes only the paths that are known to Git.</p>
<p class="Pp">File globbing matches across directory boundaries. Thus, given two
    directories <b>d</b> and <b>d2</b>, there is a difference between using
    <b>git rm 'd*'</b> and <b>git rm 'd/*'</b>, as the former will also remove
    all of directory <b>d2</b>.</p>

  FILES THAT HAVE DISAPPEARED FROM THE FILESYSTEM</a></h1>
There is no option for <b>git rm</b> to remove from the index only the paths
  that have disappeared from the filesystem. However, depending on the use case,
  there are several ways that can be done.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Using__(lqgit_commit__-a_(rq"><a class="permalink" href="#Using__(lqgit_commit__-a_(rq">Using
  &#x201C;git commit -a&#x201D;</a></h2>
If you intend that your next commit should record all modifications of tracked
  files in the working tree and record all removals of files that have been
  removed from the working tree with <b>rm</b> (as opposed to <b>git rm</b>),
  use <b>git commit -a</b>, as it will automatically notice and record all
  removals. You can also have a similar effect without committing by using
  <b>git add -u</b>.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Using__(lqgit_add__-A_(rq"><a class="permalink" href="#Using__(lqgit_add__-A_(rq">Using
  &#x201C;git add -A&#x201D;</a></h2>
When accepting a new code drop for a vendor branch, you probably want to record
  both the removal of paths and additions of new paths as well as modifications
  of existing paths.
<p class="Pp">Typically you would first remove all tracked files from the
    working tree using this command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git ls-files -z | xargs -0 rm -f
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">and then untar the new code in the working tree. Alternately you
    could <i>rsync</i> the changes into the working tree.</p>
<p class="Pp">After that, the easiest way to record all removals, additions, and
    modifications in the working tree is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git add -A
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">See <b>git-add</b>(1).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Other_ways"><a class="permalink" href="#Other_ways">Other
  ways</a></h2>
If all you really want to do is to remove from the index the files that are no
  longer present in the working tree (perhaps because your working tree is dirty
  so that you cannot use <b>git commit -a</b>), use the following command:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=D -z | xargs -0 git rm --cached
</pre>
</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SUBMODULES"><a class="permalink" href="#SUBMODULES">SUBMODULES</a></h1>
Only submodules using a gitfile (which means they were cloned with a Git version
  1.7.8 or newer) will be removed from the work tree, as their repository lives
  inside the .git directory of the superproject. If a submodule (or one of those
  nested inside it) still uses a .git directory, <b>git rm</b> will move the
  submodules git directory into the superprojects git directory to protect the
  submodule&#x2019;s history. If it exists the submodule.&lt;name&gt; section in
  the <b>gitmodules</b>(5) file will also be removed and that file will be
  staged (unless --cached or -n are used).
<p class="Pp">A submodule is considered up to date when the HEAD is the same as
    recorded in the index, no tracked files are modified and no untracked files
    that aren&#x2019;t ignored are present in the submodules work tree. Ignored
    files are deemed expendable and won&#x2019;t stop a submodule&#x2019;s work
    tree from being removed.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you only want to remove the local checkout of a submodule from
    your work tree without committing the removal, use <b>git-submodule</b>(1)
    <b>deinit</b> instead. Also see <b>gitsubmodules</b>(7) for details on
    submodule removal.</p>

<b>git rm Documentation/\*.txt</b>
<div class="Bd-indent">Removes all <b>*.txt</b> files from the index that are
  under the <b>Documentation</b> directory and any of its subdirectories.
<p class="Pp">Note that the asterisk <b>*</b> is quoted from the shell in this
    example; this lets Git, and not the shell, expand the pathnames of files and
    subdirectories under the <b>Documentation/</b> directory.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>git rm -f git-*.sh</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Because this example lets the shell expand the asterisk
  (i.e. you are listing the files explicitly), it does not remove
  <b>subdir/git-foo.sh</b>.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Each time a superproject update removes a populated submodule (e.g. when
  switching between commits before and after the removal) a stale submodule
  checkout will remain in the old location. Removing the old directory is only
  safe when it uses a gitfile, as otherwise the history of the submodule will be
  deleted too. This step will be obsolete when recursive submodule update has
  been implemented.
