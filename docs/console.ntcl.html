   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

The console window is a replacement for a real console to allow input and output
  on the standard I/O channels on platforms that do not have a real console. It
  is implemented as a separate interpreter with the Tk toolkit loaded, and
  control over this interpreter is given through the <b>console</b> command. The
  behaviour of the console window is defined mainly through the contents of the
  <i>console.tcl</i> file in the Tk library. Except for TkAqua, this command is
  not available when Tk is loaded into a tclsh interpreter with
  &#x201C;<b>package require Tk</b>&#x201D;, as a conventional terminal is
  expected to be present in that case. In TkAqua, this command is ony available
  when stdin is <b>/dev/null</b> (as is the case e.g. when the application
  embedding Tk is started from the Mac OS X Finder).
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>console eval </b><i>script</i></dt>
  <dd>Evaluate the <i>script</i> argument as a Tcl script in the console
      interpreter. The normal interpreter is accessed through the
      <b>consoleinterp</b> command in the console interpreter.</dd>
  <dt><b>console hide</b></dt>
  <dd>Hide the console window from view. Precisely equivalent to withdrawing the
      <b>.</b> window in the console interpreter.</dd>
  <dt><b>console show</b></dt>
  <dd>Display the console window. Precisely equivalent to deiconifying the
      <b>.</b> window in the console interpreter.</dd>
  <dt><b>console title </b>?<i>string</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Query or modify the title of the console window. If <i>string</i> is not
      specified, queries the title of the console window, and sets the title of
      the console window to <i>string</i> otherwise. Precisely equivalent to
      using the <b>wm title</b> command in the console interpreter.</dd>

The <b>consoleinterp</b> command in the console interpreter allows scripts to be
  evaluated in the main interpreter. It supports two subcommands: <b>eval</b>
  and <b>record</b>.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>consoleinterp eval </b><i>script</i></dt>
  <dd>Evaluates <i>script</i> as a Tcl script at the global level in the main
      interpreter.</dd>
  <dt><b>consoleinterp record </b><i>script</i></dt>
  <dd>Records and evaluates <i>script</i> as a Tcl script at the global level in
      the main interpreter as if <i>script</i> had been typed in at the
    console.</dd>
</dl>

<h1 class="Sh" id="ADDITIONAL_TRAP_CALLS"><a class="permalink" href="#ADDITIONAL_TRAP_CALLS">ADDITIONAL
  TRAP CALLS</a></h1>
There are several additional commands in the console interpreter that are called
  in response to activity in the main interpreter. <i>These are documented here
  for completeness only; they form part of</i> <i>the internal implementation of
  the console and are likely to change or</i> <i>be modified without
  warning.</i>
<p class="Pp">Output to the console from the main interpreter via the stdout and
    stderr channels is handled by invoking the <b>tk::ConsoleOutput</b> command
    in the console interpreter with two arguments. The first argument is the
    name of the channel being written to, and the second argument is the string
    being written to the channel (after encoding and end-of-line translation
    processing has been performed.)</p>
<p class="Pp">When the <b>.</b> window of the main interpreter is destroyed, the
    <b>tk::ConsoleExit</b> command in the console interpreter is called
    (assuming the console interpreter has not already been deleted itself, that
    is.)</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DEFAULT_BINDINGS"><a class="permalink" href="#DEFAULT_BINDINGS">DEFAULT
  BINDINGS</a></h1>
The default script creates a console window (implemented using a text widget)
  that has the following behaviour:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>Pressing the tab key inserts a TAB character (as defined by the Tcl \t
      escape.)</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>Pressing the return key causes the current line (if complete by the rules
      of <b>info complete</b>) to be passed to the main interpreter for
      evaluation.</dd>
  <dt>[3]</dt>
  <dd>Pressing the delete key deletes the selected text (if any text is
      selected) or the character to the right of the cursor (if not at the end
      of the line.)</dd>
  <dt>[4]</dt>
  <dd>Pressing the backspace key deletes the selected text (if any text is
      selected) or the character to the left of the cursor (of not at the start
      of the line.)</dd>
  <dt>[5]</dt>
  <dd>Pressing either Control+A or the home key causes the cursor to go to the
      start of the line (but after the prompt, if a prompt is present on the
      line.)</dd>
  <dt>[6]</dt>
  <dd>Pressing either Control+E or the end key causes the cursor to go to the
      end of the line.</dd>
  <dt>[7]</dt>
  <dd>Pressing either Control+P or the up key causes the previous entry in the
      command history to be selected.</dd>
  <dt>[8]</dt>
  <dd>Pressing either Control+N or the down key causes the next entry in the
      command history to be selected.</dd>
  <dt>[9]</dt>
  <dd>Pressing either Control+B or the left key causes the cursor to move one
      character backward as long as the cursor is not at the prompt.</dd>
  <dt>[10]</dt>
  <dd>Pressing either Control+F or the right key causes the cursor to move one
      character forward.</dd>
  <dt>[11]</dt>
  <dd>Pressing F9 rebuilds the console window by destroying all its children and
      reloading the Tcl script that defined the console's behaviour.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Most other behaviour is the same as a conventional text widget
    except for the way that the <i>&lt;&lt;Cut&gt;&gt;</i> event is handled
    identically to the <i>&lt;&lt;Copy&gt;&gt;</i> event.</p>
