The file &#x27E8;<span class="Pa">/etc/group</span>&#x27E9; consists of newline
  separated ASCII records, one per group, containing four colon
  &#x2018;<code class="Li">:</code>&#x2019; separated fields. These fields are
  as follows:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag Bl-compact">
  <dt>group</dt>
  <dd>Name of the group.</dd>
  <dt>passwd</dt>
  <dd>Group's <i class="Em">encrypted</i> password.</dd>
  <dt>gid</dt>
  <dd>The group's decimal ID.</dd>
  <dt>member</dt>
  <dd>Group members.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Ar">group</var> field is the group name used for
    granting file access to users who are members of the group. The
    <var class="Ar">gid</var> field is the number associated with the group
    name. They should both be unique across the system (and often across a group
    of systems) since they control file access. The <var class="Ar">passwd</var>
    field is an optional <i class="Em">encrypted</i> password. This field is
    rarely used and an asterisk is normally placed in it rather than leaving it
    blank. The <var class="Ar">member</var> field contains the names of users
    granted the privileges of <var class="Ar">group</var>. The member names are
    separated by commas without spaces or newlines. A user is automatically in a
    group if that group was specified in their
    <span class="Pa">/etc/passwd</span> entry and does not need to be added to
    that group in the <span class="Pa">/etc/group file.</span></p>

Processes generally find group records using one of the
  <a class="Xr">getgrent(3)</a> family of functions. On Mac OS X, these
  functions interact with the <a class="Xr">DirectoryService(8)</a> daemon,
  which reads the /etc/group file as well as searching other directory
  information services to determine groups and group membership.
