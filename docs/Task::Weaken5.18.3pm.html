   Set up some character translations and predefined strings.  \*(-- will

   double quote, and \*(R" will give a right double quote.  \*(C+ will
   give a nicer C++.  Capital omega is used to do unbreakable dashes and
   therefore won't be available.  \*(C` and \*(C' expand to `' in nroff,
   nothing in troff, for use with C<>.

Task::Weaken - Ensure that a platform has weaken support
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
One recurring problem in modules that use Scalar::Util's
  <span class="Li">&quot;weaken&quot;</span> function is that it is not present
  in the pure-perl variant.
<p class="Pp">While this isn't necesarily always a problem in a straight
    CPAN-based Perl environment, some operating system distributions only
    include the pure-Perl versions, don't include the XS version, and so weaken
    is then &quot;missing&quot; from the platform, <b>despite</b> passing a
    dependency on Scalar::Util successfully.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most notably this is RedHat Linux at time of writing, but other
    come and go and do the same thing, hence &quot;recurring problem&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The normal solution is to manually write tests in each
    distribution to ensure that <span class="Li">&quot;weaken&quot;</span> is
    available.</p>
<p class="Pp">This restores the functionality testing to a dependency you do
    once in your <i>Makefile.PL</i>, rather than something you have to write
    extra tests for each time you write a module.</p>
<p class="Pp">It should also help make the package auto-generators for the
    various operating systems play more nicely, because it introduces a
    dependency that they <b>have</b> to have a proper weaken in order to
  work.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="How_this_Task_works"><a class="permalink" href="#How_this_Task_works">How
  this Task works</a></h2>
Part of the problem seems to stem from the fact that some distributions continue
  to include modules even if they fail some of their tests.
<p class="Pp">To get around that for this module, it will do a few dirty
  tricks.</p>
<p class="Pp">If Scalar::Util is not available at all, it will issue a normal
    dependency on the module. However, if Scalar::Util is relatively new ( it is
    &gt;= 1.19 ) and the module does <b>not</b> have weaken, the install will
    bail out altogether with a long error encouraging the user to seek support
    from their vendor (this problem happens most often in vendor-packaged Perl
    versions).</p>
<p class="Pp">This distribution also contains tests to ensure that weaken is
    available using more normal methods.</p>
<p class="Pp">So if your module uses <span class="Li">&quot;weaken&quot;</span>,
    you can just add the following to your Module::Install-based
    <i>Makefile.PL</i> (or equivalent).</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
