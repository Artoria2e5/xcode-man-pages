<b>pcap_findalldevs()</b> constructs a list of network devices that can be
  opened with <b>pcap_create(3PCAP)</b> and <b>pcap_activate(3PCAP)</b> or with
  <b>pcap_open_live(3PCAP)</b>. (Note that there may be network devices that
  cannot be opened by the process calling <b>pcap_findalldevs()</b>, because,
  for example, that process does not have sufficient privileges to open them for
  capturing; if so, those devices will not appear on the list.) If
  <b>pcap_findalldevs()</b> succeeds, the pointer pointed to by <i>alldevsp</i>
  is set to point to the first element of the list, or to <b>NULL</b> if no
  devices were found (this is considered success). Each element of the list is
  of type <b>pcap_if_t</b>, and has the following members:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>next</b></dt>
  <dd>if not <b>NULL</b>, a pointer to the next element in the list; <b>NULL</b>
      for the last element of the list</dd>
  <dt><b>name</b></dt>
  <dd>a pointer to a string giving a name for the device to pass to
      <b>pcap_open_live()</b></dd>
  <dt><b>description</b></dt>
  <dd>if not <b>NULL</b>, a pointer to a string giving a human-readable
      description of the device</dd>
  <dt><b>addresses</b></dt>
  <dd>a pointer to the first element of a list of network addresses for the
      device, or <b>NULL</b> if the device has no addresses</dd>
  <dt><b>flags</b></dt>
  <dd>device flags:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>PCAP_IF_LOOPBACK</b></dt>
  <dd>set if the device is a loopback interface</dd>
  <dt><b>PCAP_IF_UP</b></dt>
  <dd>set if the device is up</dd>
  <dt><b>PCAP_IF_RUNNING</b></dt>
  <dd>set if the device is running</dd>
  <dt><b>PCAP_IF_WIRELESS</b></dt>
  <dd>set if the device is a wireless interface; this includes IrDA as well as
      radio-based networks such as IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11, so it doesn't
      just mean Wi-Fi</dd>
  <dt><b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS</b></dt>
  <dd>a bitmask for an indication of whether the adapter is connected or not;
      for wireless interfaces, &quot;connected&quot; means &quot;associated with
      a network&quot;</dd>
  <dt>The possible values for the connection status bits are:</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_UNKNOWN</b></dt>
  <dd>it's unknown whether the adapter is connected or not</dd>
  <dt><b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_CONNECTED</b></dt>

  <dt><b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_DISCONNECTED</b></dt>

  <dt><b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_NOT_APPLICABLE</b></dt>
  <dd>the notion of &quot;connected&quot; and &quot;disconnected&quot; don't
      apply to this interface; for example, it doesn't apply to a loopback
      device</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Each element of the list of addresses is of type
    <b>pcap_addr_t</b>, and has the following members:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>next</b></dt>
  <dd>if not <b>NULL</b>, a pointer to the next element in the list; <b>NULL</b>
      for the last element of the list</dd>
  <dt><b>addr</b></dt>
  <dd>a pointer to a <b>struct sockaddr</b> containing an address</dd>
  <dt><b>netmask</b></dt>
  <dd>if not <b>NULL</b>, a pointer to a <b>struct sockaddr</b> that contains
      the netmask corresponding to the address pointed to by <b>addr</b></dd>
  <dt><b>broadaddr</b></dt>
  <dd>if not <b>NULL</b>, a pointer to a <b>struct sockaddr</b> that contains
      the broadcast address corresponding to the address pointed to by
      <b>addr</b>; may be null if the device doesn't support broadcasts</dd>
  <dt><b>dstaddr</b></dt>
  <dd>if not <b>NULL</b>, a pointer to a <b>struct sockaddr</b> that contains
      the destination address corresponding to the address pointed to by
      <b>addr</b>; may be null if the device isn't a point-to-point
    interface</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that the addresses in the list of addresses might be IPv4
    addresses, IPv6 addresses, or some other type of addresses, so you must
    check the <b>sa_family</b> member of the <b>struct sockaddr</b> before
    interpreting the contents of the address; do not assume that the addresses
    are all IPv4 addresses, or even all IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. IPv4 addresses
    have the value <b>AF_INET</b>, IPv6 addresses have the value <b>AF_INET6</b>
    (which older operating systems that don't support IPv6 might not define),
    and other addresses have other values. Whether other addresses are returned,
    and what types they might have is platform-dependent. For IPv4 addresses,
    the <b>struct sockaddr</b> pointer can be interpreted as if it pointed to a
    <b>struct sockaddr_in</b>; for IPv6 addresses, it can be interpreted as if
    it pointed to a <b>struct sockaddr_in6</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list of devices must be freed with
    <b>pcap_freealldevs(3PCAP)</b>, which frees the list pointed to by
    <i>alldevs</i>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RETURN_VALUE"><a class="permalink" href="#RETURN_VALUE">RETURN
  VALUE</a></h1>
<b>pcap_findalldevs()</b> returns 0 on success and <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> on failure;
  as indicated, finding no devices is considered success, rather than failure,
  so 0 will be returned in that case. If <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> is returned,
  <i>errbuf</i> is filled in with an appropriate error message. <i>errbuf</i> is
  assumed to be able to hold at least <b>PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE</b> chars.
